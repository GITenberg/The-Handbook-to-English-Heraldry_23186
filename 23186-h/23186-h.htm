<p>In the printed book, all illustrations were line drawings using the
conventional color representations explained in Chapter&nbsp;V. For this
e-text, some illustrations are also shown in “colorized” form. All
colors were chosen to be “web-safe” for reliable display in all
browsers; they are not intented to reproduce the exact shades of
standard heraldry. When the text notes a misprint in the colors, it was
corrected for the colorized version.</p>

<p>A few very long paragraphs in the “Grammar of Heraldry” section have
been broken up to give better access to illustrations.</p>

work I have held my hand, rather than the contrary, trying to bear
always in mind that it was the hand-book of Mr. Charles Boutell and not
a production of my own. My alterations have been concerned chiefly
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
in bringing the volume up to date, a&nbsp;necessity imposed by the
creation of new orders of knighthood, and change of Sovereign.
I&nbsp;have certainly omitted a few remarks which I have thought might
be the cause of leading students of the science astray: I&nbsp;have
altered ambiguous wording to emphasise the real, and I have no doubt the
originally intended meaning. But in many points which, being deductions,
are naturally matters of opinion, I&nbsp;have left herein various
expressions of Mr. Boutell’s opinion, with which I can hardly say I
personally altogether agree or would myself put forward. I&nbsp;hold
that it is no part of an editor’s duty to air his own opinions under the
protection or repute of another’s name, and herein I have inserted
nothing for which my own opinion is the only authority.</p>

<h4><a name = "preface" id = "preface">AUTHOR’S PREFACE</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">This</span> Volume, specially prepared for
the use of students at an early period of their study of English
Heraldry, commends itself also to those inquirers who may desire to
obtain some general information on the same subject, without having any
intention to devote to Heraldry much either of their time or of their
serious regard.</p>

<p>The success, no less extraordinary than gratifying, of my larger work
on Heraldry, led me to hope that a not less favourable reception might
be extended to a simpler and much shorter essay, more decidedly
elementary in its aim and character, and yet as far as possible within
its limits complete. Such a treatise I have endeavoured to produce in
this Volume.</p>

<p>Inseparably associated with the History of our Country, and more
particularly when our national History becomes
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
the Biography of eminent Englishmen, English Heraldry has the strongest
claims upon the attention not only of all Historians, but also of all
who desire to become familiar with their writings. In like manner,
Heraldry may be studied with no less of advantage than of satisfaction
by all Artists, whether Architects, Sculptors, Painters, or Engravers.
Nor is it too much to assert that some knowledge of Heraldry, in
consequence of its singular and comprehensive utility, ought to be
estimated as a necessary element of a liberal education. In confirmation
of my own views, I&nbsp;am tempted to quote the following passage from
<span class = "smallcaps">M. Gourdon de Genouillac’s</span> introduction
to his excellent “Grammaire Héraldique,” published at Paris:&mdash;“Le
blason,” says M. de Genouillac, “est une langue qui s’est conservée dans
sa pureté primitive depuis les siècles, langue dont la connaissance, est
indispensable aux familles nobles, qui y trouvent un signe d’alliance ou
de reconnaissance, aux numismates, aux antiquaires, aux archéologues,
enfin à tous les artistes, gens de lettres, &amp;c.; cependant cette
langue est presque inconnue, et la plupart des personnes qui possedent
le droit de porter des armoiries seraient fort en peine de les expliquer
selon les termes techniques!” Heraldry, indeed, I&nbsp;believe to be a
study worthy to be universally regarded with affectionate respect, as it
certainly is eminently qualified to inspire such a sentiment in every
class of student.</p>

<p>In this spirit I have here treated the elements of the Heraldry of
England, confident that, of those who may
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
accompany me as far as I shall lead them, very many will not be content
to stop where I shall take leave of them. Thus much I promise my
companions&mdash;I will be to them a faithful guide. They may trust to
my accuracy. I&nbsp;have made no statement, have adduced no example, nor
have I exhibited any illustration, except upon authority. I&nbsp;myself
like and admire what is real and true in Heraldry; and it is by the
attractiveness of truth and reality that I desire to win for Heraldry
fresh friends, and to secure for it firm friendships.</p>

<p>It will be understood that from the authority, the practice, and the
associations of the early Heraldry of the best and most artistic eras,
I&nbsp;seek to derive a Heraldry which we may rightly consider to be our
own, and which we may transmit with honour to our successors. I&nbsp;do
not suggest the adoption, for present use, of an obsolete system. But,
while I earnestly repudiate the acceptance and the maintenance amongst
ourselves of a most degenerate substitute for a noble Science, I&nbsp;do
aspire to aid in restoring <span class = "smallcaps">Heraldry</span> to
its becoming rank, and consequently to its early popularity, now in our
own times. This is to revive the fine old Heraldry of the past, to give
to it a fresh animation, and to apply it under existing conditions to
existing uses and requirements: not, to adjust ourselves to the
circumstances of its first development, and to reproduce as copyists its
original expressions. It is not by any means a necessary condition of a
consistent revival of early Heraldry, that our revived Heraldry should
admit no deviation
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
from original usage or precedent. So long as we are thoroughly animated
by the spirit of the early Heralds, we may lead our Heraldry onwards
with the advance of time. It is for us, indeed, to prepare a Heraldry
for the future, no less than to revive true Heraldry in the time now
present. We may rightly modify, therefore, and adapt many things, in
order to establish a true conformity between our Heraldry and the
circumstances of our own era: for example, with advantage as well as
propriety we may, in a great measure, substitute Badges for Crests; and
we shall do well to adopt a style of drawing which will be perfectly
heraldic, without being positively unnatural.</p>

<p>The greater number of my Illustrations have been engraved only in
outline, with the twofold object of my being thus enabled to increase
the number of the examples, and to adapt the engravings themselves to
the reception of colour. It will be very desirable for students to
blazon the illustrations, or the majority of them, in their proper
tinctures: and those who are thoroughly in earnest will not fail to form
their own collections of additional examples, which, as a matter of
course, they will seek to obtain from original authorities. With the
exception of a few examples, my Illustrations, considerably over 400,
have all been executed expressly for this work; and they all have been
engraved by Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">R.&nbsp;B. Utting</span>. The
chief exceptions are thirteen admirable woodcuts of Scottish Seals, all
of them good illustrations of Heraldry south of the Tweed, originally
engraved for Laing’s noble quarto upon “The
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
Ancient Seals of Scotland,” published in Edinburgh. Scottish Heraldry,
I&nbsp;must add, as in any particulars of law and practice it may differ
from our Heraldry on this side of the Tweed, I&nbsp;have left in the
able hands of the Heralds of the North: at the same time, however, the
Heraldry of which I have been treating has so much that is equally at
home on either side of “the Border,” that I have never hesitated to look
for my examples and authorities to both the fair realms which now form
one Great Britain.</p>

<span class = "hidden">T</span>he sentiment unquestionably was his own
which Sir Walter Scott made delightful Di Vernon express when, with
indignant surprise, she asked Frank Osbaldistone of what his father
could have been thinking, that he had been permitted to grow up without
any knowledge of Heraldry. Sir Walter was right in his estimate of the
high value of Heraldry as an element of education: and, in professing
herself a votaress of the Herald’s “gentle science,” it was quite right
in Di Vernon to suggest to other ladies that it would be well for them
if Heraldry should find favour in their eyes also. The age of Rob Roy,
however, was far from being
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
in harmony with heraldic associations: nor was the author of “Waverley”
himself permitted to accomplish more, than to lead the way to that
revival of a popular sympathy with every expression of early Art, which
now forms one of the most remarkable characteristics of our own era.</p>

<p>In the olden time, in England, the love of Heraldry, which was
prevalent amongst all classes, was based upon an intelligent
appreciation of its worthiness. A&nbsp;part of the feudal system of the
Middle Ages, and at once derived from the prevailing form of thought and
feeling, and imparting to it a brilliant colouring peculiar to itself,
Heraldry exercised a powerful influence upon the manners and habits of
the people amongst whom it was in use. By our early ancestors,
accordingly, as Mr. Montagu has so happily written, “little given to
study of any kind, a&nbsp;knowledge of Heraldry was considered
indispensable:” to them it was the “outward sign of the spirit of
chivalry, the index, also, to a lengthened chronicle of doughty deeds.”
And this Heraldry grew up, spontaneously and naturally, out of the
circumstances and requirements of those times. It came into existence,
because it was needed for practical use; it was accepted and cherished,
because it did much more than fulfil its avowed purpose. At first,
simply useful to distinguish particular individuals, especially in war
and at the tournament, English Heraldry soon became popular; and then,
with no less rapidity, it rose to high honour and dignity.</p>

<p>From the circumstance that it first found its special use in direct
connection with military equipments, knightly exercises, and the
<i>mêlée</i> of actual battle, mediæval Heraldry has also been entitled
<span class = "smallcaps">Armory</span>. Men wore the ensigns of
Heraldry about their persons, embroidered upon the garments that
partially covered their armour,&mdash;and so they called them
<i>Coats-of-Arms</i>: they bore these same ensigns on their
shields,&mdash;and they called them <i>Shields-of-Arms</i>: and
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<a name = "page3" id = "page3"> </a>
in their Armorial Banners and Pennons they again displayed the very same
insignia, floating in the wind high above their heads, from the shafts
of their lances.</p>

<p>The Heraldry or Armory of England, an honourable and honoured member
of the illustrious family of mediæval European Heraldry, may be defined
as a symbolical and pictorial language, in which figures, devices, and
colours are employed instead of letters. Each heraldic composition has
its own definite and complete significance, conveyed through its direct
connection with some particular individual, family, dignity, or office.
Every such heraldic composition, also, is a true legal possession, held
and maintained by an express right and title: and it is hereditary, like
other real property, in accordance with certain laws and precedents of
inheritance. But in this respect heraldic insignia are singular and
unlike other property, inasmuch as it is a general rule that they cannot
be alienated, exchanged, or transferred otherwise than by inheritance or
other lawful succession. Exceptions to this rule, when they are observed
occasionally to have occurred, show clearly their own exceptional
character, and consequently they confirm the true authority of the rule
itself. It will be understood, as a necessary quality of its hereditary
nature, that the significance of an heraldic composition, while
“definite and complete” in itself, admits of augmentation and expansion
through its association with successive generations. Thus, the Royal
Shield of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> is
“complete” as the heraldic symbol of that great monarch, and of the
realm under his rule: and yet this same shield, equally “complete” (with
one simple modification) as the heraldic symbol of each successive
Sovereign till the death of <span class = "smallcaps">Elizabeth</span>,
has its significance infinitely augmented and expanded through its
hereditary association with all the Sovereigns of the Houses of
Plantagenet and Tudor.</p>

<p>Until the concluding quarter of the twelfth century, the
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page4" id = "page4"> </a>
traces of the existence of Heraldry are faint and few in number. Early
in the thirteenth century the new science began to establish itself
firmly amongst our ancestors of that age; and it is certain that, as
soon as its character and capabilities were in any degree understood
aright, it grew speedily into favour; so that in the reign of <span
class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span> (<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1216-1272) Heraldry in England had confirmed
its own claims to be regarded as a Science, by being in possession of a
system, and a classification of its own.</p>

<p>The Crusades, those extraordinary confederacies without a parallel in
the history of civilised nations, were themselves so thoroughly a matter
of religious chivalry, that it was only an inevitable result of their
existence that they should give a powerful impulse to the establishment
and development of Heraldry in its early days.</p>

<p>But Heraldry, from the time of its first appearance in England, was
found to be valuable for other uses besides those which so intimately
connected it with both real and imitative warfare, with the fierce
life-and-death conflict of the battle-field, and with the scarcely less
perilous struggle for honour and renown in the lists. Very soon after
the Norman Conquest, in consequence of their presence being required to
give validity to every species of legal document, <span class =
"smallcaps">Seals</span> became instruments of the greatest importance;
and it was soon obvious that heraldic insignia, with a representation of
the knightly shield upon which they were displayed, were exactly suited
to satisfy every requirement of the seal-engraver. By such means
Heraldry became interwoven as well with the peaceful concerns of
everyday life, as with the display of martial splendour and the turmoil
of war.</p>

<p>Many attempts have been made to set aside the opinion that the
Heraldry of the Middle Ages in England was a fresh creation,
a&nbsp;production of indigenous growth: and
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page5" id = "page5"> </a>
great is the ingenuity that has been brought into action to carry back
the Heraldry of our own country from the commencement of the thirteenth
century through the previous elementary stages of its existence, in
order to trace its direct lineal descent from certain decorative and
symbolical devices that were in use at much earlier periods. The careful
and diligent researches, however, of the most learned Heralds have at
present led them almost unanimously to reject all such theories as
these, as speculative and uncertain. At the same time, it is an
indisputable fact that, in all ages of the world, and amongst all races
of men, some form of symbolical expression has been both in use and in
favour. And it is equally true that this symbolism, whatever it may have
been, has generally been found in some way associated with a military
life and with the act of warfare. Soldiers, and particularly those in
high command, have always delighted to adorn their shields with devices
that sometimes were significant of their own condition or exploits, or
sometimes had reference to their country, or even to their families;
and, in like manner, it has been a universal custom to display similar
devices and figures in military standards of all kinds. At the time of
the Conquest, as is shown in the famous Bayeux Tapestry of the
Conqueror’s Consort, the shields and standards of both Normans and
Anglo-Saxons were painted, and perhaps the latter were embroidered, with
various figures and devices; but certainly without any heraldic
significance or any personal associations being indicated by these
figures and devices, which bear a general resemblance to the insignia of
the Legions and Cohorts of Imperial Rome. Figures Nos. 5 and 6 give
representations of the standards that are introduced into the Bayeux
Tapestry. The same species of decoration, consisting chiefly of painted
patterns, with discs, stars, crescents, and some other figures,
continued in use in our own country until superseded by a true Heraldry;
and may
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page6" id = "page6"> </a>
also be assumed to have prevailed in England in much earlier times.</p>

Nos. 5 and 6.&mdash;Lance Flags&mdash;Bayeux Tapestry.</p>

<p>In still more remote ages a more decided heraldic system was
displayed upon signets, coins, shields, and standards. In this ancient
Heraldry, if so it may be termed, occasionally the important and
characteristic quality of hereditary association in certain devices is
apparent. Thus, Virgil (Æneid, vii. 657) assigns to Aventinus
“<i>insigne paternum</i>” upon his shield&mdash;his hereditary device,
derived by him from his father. But these devices generally appear to
have their significance in a greater or a less degree restricted,
amongst the ancients, to certain particular incidents; consequently in
all these examples there is nothing to show that the man who bore one
device at one time, did not bear another device at another time.<a class
= "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> For example,
Æschylus, the Greek tragedian (<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span>
600), has recorded that Capaneus, when attacking the
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page7" id = "page7"> </a>
city of Thebes, bore on his shield the figure of a warrior carrying a
lighted torch, with the motto, “I will fire the city!” But, on another
occasion, we have reason to believe that the same Capaneus bore quite a
different device, applicable to that other occasion; and this deprives
these ancient devices, heraldic as they are in their general character,
of that special personal association which true Heraldry requires and,
indeed, implies. The beautiful painted vases, the works of Greek
artists, that are discovered in such extraordinary numbers and in
perfect preservation in some parts of Italy, constantly give most
striking representations of the shields of ancient Greek warriors and
other personages, with what appear heraldic devices displayed upon them.
These shields illustrate, in a remarkable manner, both the appropriate
significance of particular devices, and the usage then prevalent for a
variety of devices to be borne on different occasions by the same
individual. Shields upon vases in the collections in the Museum of the
Louvre at Paris, and in the British Museum, where they are easy of
access, contain a great variety of devices. The examples, Nos. 7, 8, 9,
and 10, are from our own National Collections. No. 7, the shield black,
the border and the pegasus red; No. 8, the shield black, and the two
dolphins white; No. 9, the shield black, with a border adorned with red
discs, the serpent white; No. 10, the shield black, with
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8" id = "page8"> </a>
purple border, the three human legs conjoined white. The shields, Nos. 9
and 10, are both borne by the goddess <span class = "greek" title =
"ATHÊNÊ">ΑΘΗΝΗ</span> (Minerva); and the remarkable device displayed on
No. 10 is also found on the coins of ancient Sicily. Other similar
shields display lions, horses, dogs, wild boars, fish, birds, clusters
of leaves, chariots and chariot-wheels, votive tripods, serpents,
scorpions, with many others, including occasional examples of human
figures. In another collection I have seen an anchor and an Amazon’s
bow. A&nbsp;device differing from that in No. 10 only in having the
conjoined limbs in armour, will be found in our own English Heraldry to
be the armorial ensign of the Isle of Man.</p>

<p>This Heraldry of Antiquity is to be regarded as the predecessor, and
not as the ancestor of the Heraldry of England. There may be much that
is common to both; but, there is nothing to show the later system to
have been a
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9" id = "page9"> </a>
lineal descendant from the earlier. It would seem much more likely that
Heraldry, when it had been evolved, adopted ready made the emblems of an
older civilisation for its own purpose, often appropriating at the same
time the symbolism attaching to the emblems. The Heraldry, therefore,
that has flourished, declined, and now is in the act of reviving in our
own country in almost the full vigour of its best days, I&nbsp;shall
treat as an independent science, proceeding from a single source, and
from thence flowing onwards with varied fortunes, side by side with the
chequered chronicles of England. In the course of its progress from the
palmy days of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>, it has
had to encounter, in a degree without precedent or parallel, that most
painful and mischievous of trials&mdash;the excessive admiration of
injudicious friends. Hence, Heraldry was brought into disrepute, and
even into contempt, by the very persons who loved it with a genuine but
a most unwise love. In process of time, no nonsense appeared too
extravagant, and no fable too wild, to be engrafted upon the grave
dignity of the Herald’s early science. Better times at length have
succeeded. Heraldry now has friends and admirers, zealous as of old,
whose zeal is guided aright by a sound judgment in alliance with a pure
taste. Very much already has been accomplished to sweep away the amazing
mass of absurdities and errors which had overwhelmed our English
Heraldry, by such men as Nicholas, Nichols, Courthope, Seton, Planché,
Walford, Montagu, and Lower: and the good work goes on and prospers,
with the most cheering assurances of complete and triumphant
success.</p>

<p class = "footnote">
<a name = "note1" id = "note1" href = "#tag1">1.</a>
In his “Hand-book of Engraved Gems,” Mr. King maintains that “the
devices on the signets of the ancients were both hereditary and
unalterable, like our armorial bearings;” but, at the same time, he
admits that the “armorial bearings,” which appear “on the shields of the
Grecian heroes in the most ancient pictures extant, the Vase-paintings,”
“seem to have been assumed at the caprice of the individual, like the
knight’s <i>cognisances</i> at tournaments in the days of chivalry, and
not to have been hereditary.”&mdash;“Hand-book,” page 216. Almost
immediately, however, Mr. King adds, that traditions exist which
represent the mythic heroes bearing “engraved on their signets the same
devices that decorated their shields.” It would seem that the argument
from such traditions would rather indicate the signet-devices to have
been arbitrary, than the shield-devices to have been unalterable. While
I readily admit the very interesting devices of antiquity to possess
decided heraldic attributes, I&nbsp;cannot consider Mr. King to have
shown that, as a general rule, they were held by the ancients themselves
to have been either “unalterable” or “hereditary.” Possibly, further
light may be thrown upon the hereditary quality of ancient Heraldry:
but, I&nbsp;certainly do not expect to see any evidence adduced, which
would establish a line of descent connecting the Mediæval Heraldry of
England with any heraldic system of classic antiquity.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">At</span> the head of the earliest existing
authorities in English Heraldry are <span class =
"smallcaps">Seals</span>. To the fortunate circumstance of the legal
importance attached to them we are indebted for the preservation of
these equally interesting and valuable relics, in great variety and in
very considerable numbers. The heraldic evidence of Seals is necessarily
of the highest order. They are original works, possessing
contemporaneous authority. Produced with peculiar care and approved by
their first possessors, their original authenticity is confirmed by
their continued use through successive generations.</p>

<p>Having been in use before the introduction and adoption of Heraldry
in England, Seals enable us to compare the devices that preceded true
Heraldry with the earliest that are truly heraldic: and thus they show
that, in many instances, regular coats-of-arms were derived in their
hereditary bearings from similar devices that had been adopted in the
same families before the heraldic era. For example: the Seal of John
Mundegumri, about <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1175, bears a
<i>single fleur-de-lys</i>, not placed upon a shield; and, accordingly,
here is seen the origin of the <i>three golden fleurs-de-lys</i>, borne
afterwards upon a blue shield by the descendants
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11" id = "page11"> </a>
of this John, the Montgomeries, Earls of Eglintoun. Again: the Seal of
Walter Innes, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1431, displays the
shield of arms of his house&mdash;<i>three blue mullets</i> (stars
generally of five rays) on a field of silver, No. 11; and these mullets
may be traced to the <i>single star</i>, that appears on the Seal of
William Innes, or De Ynays, No. 12, appended to his deed of homage to
Edward I., in the year 1295. I&nbsp;have selected these examples from
the “Catalogue of Scottish Seals,” published by Mr. Laing, of Edinburgh,
that I may be enabled here to refer in the highest terms of admiring
commendation to that most excellent work. It is greatly to be desired
that a corresponding publication should treat, with equal ability, of
the Seals of England which, from the dawn of Heraldry, continue their
admirable examples and illustrations throughout its career.</p>

<p>Monumental Effigies, Sepulchral Memorials, early Buildings, and early
Stained Glass, frequently are rich in authoritative examples of “the
figures of Heraldry.” In addition to the various forms and combinations
of heraldic composition, these works illustrate the early style of
drawing in favour with Heralds during the great eras of mediæval Art,
and they have preserved to us most useful and suggestive representations
of various devices in their proper heraldic aspect. In many instances
the Heraldry of early Monuments and Architecture possesses a peculiar
value, arising from the circumstance of the shields of arms and other
insignia having been sculptured in low relief or outlined in incised
lines, and consequently these devices
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12" id = "page12"> </a>
and compositions retain their original forms: and, in like manner, the
original colouring of the Heraldry of Stained Glass remains safe from
restoration or destruction, in consequence of the impossibility of
re-painting&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The early written Literature of English Heraldry is calculated to
throw but little light upon either its true character or its history. In
addition, however, to the various and numerous official documents of the
Heralds’ College, several examples of one particular class of heraldic
record have been preserved, the value of which cannot be too highly
estimated. These are <span class = "smallcaps">Rolls of
Arms</span>&mdash;long, narrow strips of parchment, on which are written
lists of the names and titles of certain personages, with full
descriptions of their armorial insignia. The circumstances under which
these Rolls were prepared are obviously not identical and for the most
part unknown: but, the exact accuracy of their statements has been
established beyond all question by careful and repeated comparison with
Seals and other Monuments, and also with Documents which give only an
indirect and yet not the less conclusive corroboration to the records of
the Rolls of Arms themselves. The earliest of these Rolls at present
known date about <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1240 to 1245;
and since in these earliest Rolls a very decided technical language is
uniformly adopted, and the descriptions are all given in palpable
accordance with fixed rules which must then have been well understood,
we infer that by the end of the first half of the thirteenth century
there was in existence a system for the regulation of such matters.
Heraldry was perhaps recognised as a Science, with fixed terms and rules
for describing heraldic devices and figures, and established laws to
direct the granting, the assuming, and the bearing of arms.</p>

<p>The most interesting of these early heraldic Rolls records, in a
metrical form, and in Norman-French, the siege and capture of the
fortress of Carlaverock, on the Scottish border, by <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>, in the year 1300. In
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13" id = "page13"> </a>
addition to very curious descriptions of the muster of the Royal troops
at Carlisle, their march northwards, and the incidents of the siege
(which last have a strange resemblance to what Homer has recorded of
incidents that took place during the siege of Troy), this Roll gives
some graphic personal sketches of the princes, nobles, bannerets, and
knights, whose banners and shields of arms are set forth in it with
minute exactness. This Roll, as well as several others, has been
published, with translations and very valuable notes.</p>

<p>In the Manuscript Collections of the British Museum also, and of
other Libraries both public and private, and in the County Histories,
and other works of a cognate character, there are many documents which
contain various important records and illustrations of early English
Heraldry.</p>

<p>In any references to authorities, that it may appear desirable for me
to make in the course of this and the following chapters, I&nbsp;must be
as concise as possible. A&nbsp;direct reference to Seals, Effigies,
&amp;c., will be necessary in each case: but, in referring to Rolls of
Arms, it will be sufficient to denote the period of the authority in
general terms. Accordingly, I&nbsp;shall refer, not to each particular

Leicester.</p>
</div>

<p>Amongst the earliest Shields and Banners of Arms, all of them
remarkable for their simplicity, many are found to be without any device
whatever, their distinction consisting simply in some peculiarity in the
colouring. Such examples may be considered to have been derived from
pre-heraldic times, and transmitted, without any change or addition, to
later periods. The renowned Banner of the Knights Templars, by them
called <i>Beauseant</i>, No. 13, is black above and white below, which
is said to have
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14" id = "page14"> </a>
denoted that, while fierce to their foes, they were gracious to their
friends. An ancient Banner of the Earl of Leicester (H.&nbsp;3) is white
and red, the division being made by a vertical indented line; No. 14.
This design, however, was not the coat of arms of the earl. The Shield
of the ducal House of Brittany, closely connected with the Royal Family
of England, is simply of the fur ermine; No. 15. The Shield of
Waldegrave is silver and red, as in No. 16: and that of Fitz Warine
(H.&nbsp;3), also of silver and red, is treated as in No.&nbsp;17.</p>

No. 18.&mdash; Shield at Whitworth.</p>
</div>

<p>Some of the earliest of the simple devices of true Heraldry were
evidently adopted from the <i>structural formation</i> (or from a
<i>structural strengthening</i>) of the Shields, on which they were
displayed. Thus, a&nbsp;raised border, and bands of metal variously
disposed in order to impart additional strength to a shield, with
distinct colouring, would produce a series of heraldic compositions.
A&nbsp;good example occurs in the shield of an early Effigy at
Whitworth, Durham, No. 18, in which the heads of the rivets or screws
employed to fix the border on the shield, appear to have been made to
assume
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15" id = "page15"> </a>
the character of heraldic additions to the simple border and horizontal
bands. Other primary devices of the same simple order, which in like
manner may have had a structural origin, I&nbsp;shall consider in detail
in subsequent chapters. (See particularly <a href =
"#chapVI">Chapter&nbsp;VI.</a>)</p>

No. 19.&mdash; The Escarbuncle.</p>
</div>

<p>The central boss, at once an appropriate ornament of an early shield,
and an important addition to its defensive qualities, when extended in
the form of decorative metal-work, would readily suggest a variety of
heraldic figures, and amongst others several beautiful modifications of
a simple cruciform device which it might be made to assume. The figure
called an escarbuncle, No. 19, is simply a shield-boss developed into
decorative structural metal-work. This figure appears in the Temple
Church, London, upon the shield of an Effigy, which Mr. J. Gough Nichols
has shown to have been incorrectly attributed to Geoffrey de Mandeville,
Earl of Essex.</p>

<p>The greater number of the earliest devices that appear in English
Heraldry were adopted for the express purpose of their having some
<i>allusive association</i>, through a similarity of sound in their own
names or descriptions with the names and titles or the territories of
certain persons, dignities, and places. In exact accordance with the
principles and aim of primitive mediæval Heraldry, and in perfect
harmony with the sentiments and requirements of the age in which it grew
up into a science, devices of this kind addressed themselves in very
plain and expressive language to the men of their own era. In them they
saw the kind of symbolical writing that they could remember, as well as
understand.
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page16" id = "page16"> </a>
They also evidently liked the quaint style of suggestiveness that was a
characteristic of these allusive devices: and, it is more than probable
that there frequently lurked in them a humorous significance, which by
no means tended to detract from their popularity. Devices of this same
order have never ceased to be in favour with Heralds and lovers of
Heraldry. They were used in the sixteenth century at least as commonly
as in the thirteenth; but, as would be expected, in the later period
they often became complicated, far-fetched, and extravagant.</p>

<p>This allusive quality, distinguished in English Heraldry as
“<i>canting</i>,” has commonly been misunderstood, and therefore
incorrectly estimated, by modern writers, who have supposed it to be a
fantastic conceit of the Heralds of a degenerate age. By writers such as
these, accordingly, all “<i>canting arms</i>” (by French Heralds called
“<i>armes parlantes</i>”) have been absurdly assigned to a separate
class, in their estimation having an inferior heraldic grade.</p>

</div>

<p>The prevalence of the allusive quality in early arms may be assumed
to have been even more general than is now apparent, since so many of
the original echoes and allusions have become obscured or altogether
lost in the lapse of time, and through the changes that have taken place
since the accession of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>
in the French language and in our own also. The use of the Latin
language, again, in the Middle Ages led, at later periods, to
translations of names; French names, too, were translated in the same
manner into English equivalents: and, at other times, the sound of a
Latin or a French (Anglo-Norman) name was transferred to an English
representative having a somewhat similar sound, without the slightest
reference to the original signification. Who, for example, in the name
of <span class = "smallcaps">Montagu</span> now recognises instinctively
the original allusion to a <i>mountain</i> with its <i>sharply</i>
peaked crests, and so discerns the probable allusive origin of the
<i>sharp</i> triple points of the devices on
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17" id = "page17"> </a>
the old Montacute shield, No. 20? It is easy to see how much must have
been unconsciously done, by such changes in names and their
associations, to obliterate what once was clear, significant, and
expressive. I&nbsp;must be content here to give, simply by way of
explanatory illustration, a&nbsp;very few examples of allusive arms;
and, in so doing, it may be well for me to observe that the early
Heralds of our country always employed the French language as it was
spoken in their own times in England as well as in France. In the time
of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>, G.&nbsp;de Lucy has
for his arms <i>three lucies</i>&mdash;fish now known as pike: Robert
Quency has a <i>quintefueil</i>&mdash;a flower of five leaves: Thos.
Corbett has <i>two corbeaux</i>&mdash;ravens: A.&nbsp;de Swyneburne has
“<i>trois testes de senglier</i>”&mdash;three heads of the wild boar, or
<i>swine</i>: (E.&nbsp;2), Sir R. de Eschales has <i>six
escallops</i>&mdash;<i>shells</i>: Sir G. de Trompintoun, of
Trumpington, near Cambridge, has <i>two trompes</i>&mdash;trumpets: Sir
J. Bordoun has <i>three bourdons</i>&mdash;pilgrim’s staves: Sir
G.&nbsp;Rossel has <i>three roses</i>: and Sir O. Heron has the same
number of <i>herons</i>. So also, for the Spanish provinces Castile and
Leon, a&nbsp;<i>castle</i> and a <i>lion</i>: for Falconer,
a&nbsp;<i>falcon</i>: Butler, <i>cups</i>: Forester, <i>bugle-horns</i>:
Arundel, <i>hirondelles</i>&mdash;swallows: Wingfield, <i>wings</i>:
Shelley, <i>shells</i>: Pigot, <i>pick-axes</i>: Leveson, <i>leaves</i>:
and Martel, <i>martels</i>&mdash;hammers. The <i>Broom-plant</i> with
its seed-pods, in Latin <i>Planta genista</i>, No. 21, gave its name to
the <span class = "smallcaps">Plantagenet</span> Dynasty. I&nbsp;shall
hereafter add several other curious examples of devices of this class,
when treating of <i>Badges</i>, <i>Rebuses</i>, and <i>Mottoes</i>.</p>

<p>There is one class of early arms, which it is important
<span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18" id = "page18"> </a>
that students of Armory should observe with especial care, lest they be
led by them into unexpected errors. These are arms that were invented
<i>after</i> Heraldry had been established, and then were assigned to
personages of historical eminence who had lived and died <i>before</i>
the true heraldic era. In the days in which every person of prominence
bore heraldic arms, and when Heraldry had attained to high renown, it
was natural enough to consider that suitable armorial devices and
compositions should be assigned to the men of mark in earlier ages, both
to distinguish them in accordance with the usage then prevalent, and to
treat their memory with becoming honour. Such arms were also in a sense
necessary to their descendants for the purposes of quartering. No proof
can be shown that the arms said to have been borne by <span class =
"smallcaps">William the Conqueror</span> are not of this
order&mdash;made for him, that is, and attributed to him in after times,
but of which he himself had no knowledge. These arms, No. 22, differ
from the true Royal Insignia of England only in there being <i>two</i>,
instead of <i>three</i>, lions displayed upon the shield. The arms of
<span class = "smallcaps">Edward the Confessor</span>, <a href =
"#fig2">No.&nbsp;2</a>, were certainly devised long after his death, and
they appear to have been suggested to the heralds of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span> by one of the Confessor’s coins: the
shield is blue, and the cross and five birds (martlets) are gold. In
like manner, the arms attributed to the earlier Saxon Sovereigns of
England, No. 23, a&nbsp;gold cross upon
<span class = "pagenum">19</span>
<a name = "page19" id = "page19"> </a>
blue, are really not earlier than the thirteenth century. The arms,
<a href = "#fig2">No.&nbsp;2</a>, having been assigned to <span class =
"smallcaps">St. Edward</span>, a&nbsp;patron saint of mediæval England,
were long regarded with peculiar reverence. I&nbsp;have placed them,

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">English</span> Heraldry, as it exists amongst
us in our own times, is the very same Heraldry that flourished under the
kindly influences of the greatest of the Plantagenets, though perhaps
modified in some details by changed circumstances. It is not of a new,
but of the old, Heraldry of England that I am setting forth the
elements. Our Heraldry has had to pass from good days to bad ones: and,
having gone through the worst of bad days, the circle at length has
revolved, so that we are witnessing the happy change of a vigorous
heraldic revival. Heraldry already enjoys a very great popularity; and,
without a doubt, it will become still more popular, in the degree that
it is better and more generally understood. For its complete ultimate
success, the present revival of true English Heraldry must mainly depend
upon the manner in which we apply the lessons that may be learned by us,
no less from the warnings of the recent evil days of the science, than
from the example of the brilliant ones that preceded them long ago. Nor
should we deal faithfully with our revived Heraldry, were we not to form
a just estimate of whatever was imperfect in the best era of its early
history, in order to apply to present improvement the lessons that thus
also may be learned. It must be admitted that the Heralds and Heraldic
writers of the 17th century, following the footsteps of some of their
immediate predecessors, led the
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21" id = "page21"> </a>
way towards the thorough debasement of their own science. Their example
was not without effect upon those who followed them&mdash;men quite
equal to the perpetration of whatever had not been already done to bring
Heraldry into contempt. This was accomplished first, by gravely
discoursing, in early heraldic language, upon the imaginary Heraldry of
the patriarchal and antediluvian worthies: making a true coat of arms of
Joseph’s “coat of many colours,” giving armorial ensigns to David and
Gideon, to Samson and Joshua, to “that worthy gentilman Japheth,” to
Jubal and Tubal-Cain, and crowning the whole by declaring that our
common progenitor, Adam, bore on his own red shield Eve’s shield of
silver, after the mediæval fashion that would denote his wife to have
been an heiress!</p>

<p>Then there set in a flood of allegorical and fantastic absurdities,
by which the fair domain of Heraldry was absolutely overwhelmed. Wild
and strange speculations, in a truly vain philosophy, interwoven with
distorted images of both the myths and the veritable records of classic
antiquity, were either deduced from armorial blazonry, or set forth as
the sources from whence it was developed. Fables and anecdotes, having
reference to less remote eras, were produced in great variety and in
copious abundance. The presence in blazon of animated beings of
whatsoever kinds, whether real or fabulous, led to rambling
disquisitions in the most ludicrously <i>un</i>natural of imaginary
Natural History. From every variety also of inanimate figure and device,
the simplest no less than the more elaborate, after the same fashion
some “moral” was sought to be extracted. The technical language, too, of
the early Heralds, had its expressive simplicity travestied by a
complicated jargon, replete with marvellous assertions, absurd
doctrines, covert allusions devoid of consistent significance, quaint
and yet trivial conceits, and bombastic rhapsodies. Even the
nomenclature of the Tinctures was not exempt from a characteristic
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page22" id = "page22"> </a>
course of “treatment,” two distinctive additional sets of titles for
gold, silver, blue, red, &amp;c., having been devised and substituted
for those in general use (see <a href = "#chapV">Chapter V.</a>); of
these the one set was derived from the names of the <i>Planets</i>, and
employed to emblazon the insignia of Sovereign Princes; and the other
set, derived from the names of <i>Jewels</i>, was applied to the arms of
Nobles. In the midst of all the rubbish, however, which they thus
delighted to accumulate, there may generally be discovered in the works
of writers of this class, here and there, references to earlier usages
and illustrations of original principles which, in the extreme dearth of
genuine early heraldic literature, are both interesting and of real
value. Nor are these writings without their value, estimated from
another point of view, as contemporaneous and unconscious commentaries
upon the history of their own times. It must be added that, in more than
a few instances, beneath the surface there lurks a vein of both
political and personal allusion, of which the point and bearing now are
altogether lost, or at the most are only open to conjecture and surmise.
And, again, even in their most extravagant and frivolous lucubrations,
the heraldic writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries are not
without touches of humour; as when Gerard Legh (<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1562), discoursing of “beastes,” remarks of the
“Ramme” that in “aucthoritye he is a Duke, for hee hath the leadyng of
multitudes and flockes of his own kynde;” and of the ass, “I could write
much of this beaste, but that it might be thought it were to mine own
glorie.”</p>

<p>The adoption of additional quarterings for the purpose of display,
and the introduction of more complicated compositions in the time of
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span>, were speedily
followed by the substitution of pictorial representations, often of a
most frivolous and inconsistent character, and many of them altogether
unintelligible without written explanations, instead of the simple,
dignified, and expressive
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23" id = "page23"> </a>
insignia of true Heraldry. For example, in the year 1760, a&nbsp;grant
of arms was made to a Lincolnshire family named Tetlow, which, with
thirteen other figures, includes the representation of a book duly
clasped and ornamented, having on it a silver penny; while above the
book rests a dove, holding in its beak a crow-quill! This was to
commemorate one of the family having, with a crow-quill, actually
achieved the exploit of writing the Lord’s Prayer within the compass of
a silver penny. Amongst the most objectionable of the arms of this class
are those which were granted to distinguished naval and military
officers&mdash;arms, that certainly ought to have conferred fresh honour
on illustrious names, instead of inflicting dishonour upon Heraldry
itself. Battles by sea and land, landscapes and sea views and fortified
cities, flags of all kinds, with medals and ribbons, all of them
intermixed with devices not quite so unheraldic, abound in these
extravagant compositions. The arms of Lord Nelson, and still more
recently those of General Lord Gough, may be specified as flagrant
examples of this degenerate pictorial Heraldry. The Duke of Wellington
happily escaped a similar infliction. It would be but too easy to
enumerate other equally inconsistent and unheraldic compositions: but,
I&nbsp;must be content to refer only to the armorial shield granted to
the great astronomer, Sir John Herschel, on which is displayed his
forty-foot reflecting telescope, with all its apparatus! These, and all
such violations of heraldic truth and consistency, though in some
instances they are of very recent date, are now to be assigned to a
closed chapter in the history of English Heraldry. But in considering
them it must not be forgotten that this kind of grant was not confined
to this country, but flourished to a still greater extent abroad.</p>

<p>In our present revival of English Heraldry, it is essential that we
impress upon our minds a correct conception
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<a name = "page24" id = "page24"> </a>
of the twofold character of all Heraldry&mdash;that it is a
<i>Science</i>, and also that it is an <i>Art</i>. We have to vindicate
the reputation of our Heraldry, as well in the one capacity as in the
other. Of very noble heraldic Art we happily possess original examples
in great numbers, which have been bequeathed to us, as a precious
inheritance, from “the brave days of old.” The style of Art that we see
exemplified in these early authorities we may accept almost unreservedly
as our own style; and we must aspire to sympathise heartily with their
genuine heraldic feeling. In our representation, also, of almost all
inanimate and natural objects in our own armorial compositions, as a
general rule, we may trust confidently to the same good guidance. The
early method of representation, indeed, must form the basis of our
system of treatment; and, we may faithfully adhere to this rule, and yet
occasionally we may find it to be desirable that the form and the
accessories of some devices should be adapted to modern associations. In
truth, it is not by merely copying the works of even the greatest of the
early heraldic artists, that we are to become masters in heraldic Art.
When the copies are good, copying is always valuable, as a branch of
study; but, if it be our highest and only aim to reproduce the
expressions of other men’s thoughts, then copying is worse than
worthless. What we have to do is to express our heraldic Art in the
spirit of the early Heralds, to keep it in harmony with what, in the
best of the early days, they would have accepted as the highest heraldic
Art, and at the same time to show that our heraldic Art in very truth is
our own.</p>

<p>The treatment of animate creatures in Heraldry requires a certain
kind, and also a certain degree, of conventionalism. Here, as before, in
the early Heralds we have excellent masters; but, here we must follow
their teaching with more of reserve, and with cautious steps. We
recognise the happy
<span class = "pagenum">25</span>
<a name = "page25" id = "page25"> </a>
consistency of the conventionalism which they displayed in their
representation of animate creatures, without any purpose to adopt it in
the same degree with them. Had the early Heralds been more familiar with
the living presence of the various creatures that they summoned to enter
into their service, without a doubt they would have represented them
with a much closer conformity to Nature. We must apply our better
knowledge, as we may feel confident the early Heralds would have applied
a similar knowledge had they been able to have acquired it. Heraldic
animals of every kind&mdash;lions, eagles, dolphins, and all
others&mdash;must be so far subjected to a conventional treatment, that
they will not exhibit a <i>strictly</i> natural appearance: and, on the
other hand, being carefully preserved from all exaggerated
conventionalisms, they must approach as near to Nature as a definite
conventional rendering of natural truth will admit. The lions of the
early Heralds, spirited beasts always, generally show a decided
disposition to exhibit their heraldic sympathies in excess. They have in
them rather too much that is heraldic conventionalism, and not quite
enough that is natural lion. And, with the first symptoms of decline in
heraldic Art, the treatment of lions showed signs of a tendency to carry
conventionalism to the utmost extravagance. The same remarks are
applicable to eagles. It must be added, however, that truly admirable
examples of heraldic animals occasionally may be found as late even as
the commencement of the sixteenth century, as in the chantry of Abbot
Ramryge, in the Abbey Church at St. Alban’s, and in King’s College
Chapel at Cambridge. It must be our care to blend together the true
attributes of the living lion and eagle, and those also of other living
creatures, with the traditional peculiarities of their heraldic
representatives. And we must extend the corresponding application of the
same principles of treatment to imaginary beings and heraldic monsters,
as they occur in our Heraldry.

The shield, <a href = "#fig24">No. 24</a>, of Prince <span class =

"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>, finely sculptured with his effigy
in alabaster, in Westminster Abbey (<span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1336), and in perfect preservation, gives us
characteristic examples of lions of the best heraldic era, their frames,
attenuated as they are, being perfect types of fierce elasticity. With
this shield may be grouped others, having admirably suggestive examples
of heraldic lions of a somewhat later date, which are preserved upon the
monuments of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> and the
<span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, severally at Westminster
and Canterbury. I&nbsp;shall refer to these fine shields again, and to
other admirable examples with them, hereafter (<a href =
"#chapIX">Chapter IX.</a>). The conventionalism in all these examples,
however felicitous the manner in which it is treated in them, is very
decidedly exaggerated. These examples, and others such as these, are not
the less
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<a name = "page27" id = "page27"> </a>
valuable to us because their teaching includes an illustration of the
excesses that we must always be careful to avoid. I&nbsp;may here
observe, that on the subject of armorial Art I leave my examples (all of
them selected from the most characteristic authorities, and engraved
with scrupulous fidelity) for the most part to convey their own lessons
and suggestions: my own suggestion to students being that, in such
living creatures as they may represent in their compositions, while they
are careful to preserve heraldic consistency and to express heraldic
feeling, they exhibit beauty of form coupled with freedom of action and
an appropriate expression. “Freedom of action” I&nbsp;intend to imply
more than such skilful drawing, as will impart to any particular
creature the idea of free movement of frame and limb: it refers also to
repeated representations of the same creature, under the same heraldic
conditions of motive and attitude. And, here “freedom of action” implies
those slight, yet significant, modifications of minor details which,
without in the least degree affecting armorial truth, prevent even the
semblance of monotonous reiteration. Thus, at Beverley, in the Percy
Shrine in the Minster, upon a shield of England the three lions are all
heraldically the same; but, there is nothing of sameness in them
nevertheless, because in each one there is some little variety in
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>

the turn of the head, or in the placing of the paws, or in the sweep of
the tail. And again, in Westminster Hall, the favourite badge of Richard
II., a&nbsp;white hart, chained, and in an attitude of rest, is repeated
as many as eighty-three times; and all are equally consistent with
heraldic truth and accuracy, without any one of them being an exact
counterpart of any other. In Nos. 25 and 26 two examples are shown from
this remarkable series of representations of this beautiful badge, each
one different from the other, and yet both really the same.</p>

The Language of Heraldry&mdash; The Nomenclature&mdash; Style and Forms

Divisions, Dividing Lines, Varieties of Form, and Heraldic

“The shield hangs down on every breast.” &mdash;<span class =

<p class = "first">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Language of Heraldry.</span>&mdash;The
original language of English Heraldry was the Norman-French, which may
also be designated Anglo-Norman, habitually spoken at the Court of
England in the early heraldic era. After a while, a&nbsp;mixed language
succeeded, compounded of English and the original Norman-French; and
this mixed language still continues in use.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Nomenclature.</span>&mdash;Like its
language, the Nomenclature of English Heraldry is of a mixed character,
in part technical and peculiar to itself, and in part the same that is
in common use. Thus, many of the figures and devices of Heraldry have
their peculiar heraldic names and titles, while still more bear their
ordinary designations. Descriptive terms, whether expressed in English
or in French (Anglo-Norman), are generally employed with a special
heraldic intention and significance. In the earliest Roll of Arms known
to be now in existence, which was compiled (as appears from internal
evidence) between the years 1240 and 1245, the Nomenclature is the same
that is found
<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30" id = "page30"> </a>
in Rolls and other heraldic documents of a later date. This fact of the
existence of a definite Nomenclature at that time, proves that before
the middle of the thirteenth century the Heraldry of England was subject
to a systematic course of treatment, and had become established and
recognised as a distinct and independent Science.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Style and Forms of
Expression.</span>&mdash;With the Nomenclature, a&nbsp;settled Style and
certain fixed technical Forms of Expression were introduced and accepted
in the thirteenth century; and, since that period, the Style and Forms
of Expression have undergone only such comparatively slight
modifications as tended to render them both more complete and more
consistent. As it was at the first, it still is the essence of heraldic
language to be concise yet complete, expressive, and also abounding in
suggestions. Not a syllable is expressed that is not absolutely
necessary; not a syllable omitted, the absence of which might possibly
lead to any doubt or uncertainty. In the more matured style, the
repetition of any important word in the same sentence is scrupulously
avoided; and, where it would be required, another form of expression is
substituted in its stead. Much meaning also is left to be implied and
understood, through inference, either based upon certain accepted rules
and established heraldic usages for the arrangement of the words and
clauses of a sentence, or derived from the natural qualities and
characteristic conditions of certain figures and devices: but, nothing
is ever left to be inferred when an uncertain inference might possibly
be adopted, or that can be understood clearly and with certainty only by
means of an explicit statement. Superfluous words and particles of all
kinds are altogether omitted. Descriptive epithets follow the nouns to
which they refer: as, a&nbsp;<i>red cross</i> is styled a <i>cross
gules</i>. The general rules, by which the arrangement of the words in
heraldic descriptive sentences
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
<a name = "page31" id = "page31"> </a>
is determined, will be found in the last subdivision of this chapter.
Examples of heraldic Language, Nomenclature, Style and Forms of
Expression, will be given in abundance throughout the following chapters
and sections of this treatise. With these examples students will do well
to familiarise themselves: then, let them prepare additional examples
for that “practice,” which (as Parker’s “Glossary of Heraldry” says, p.
60) “alone will make perfect,” by writing down correct descriptions of
heraldic compositions from the compositions themselves; after which
process they may advantageously reverse the order of their study, and
make drawings of these same (or, if they prefer it, of some other)
heraldic compositions from their own written descriptions of them.</p>

<p>When any heraldic description of a figure, device, or composition has
been completed, a&nbsp;statement is made to signify the person, family,
community, or realm whose armorial ensign it may be. This is done by
simply writing the appropriate name, after the last word of the
description; or, by prefixing the word “for” before the name when it is
placed in the same position. Thus, a&nbsp;description of the three lions
of England is to be followed by the word&mdash;“<span class =
"smallcaps">England</span>”; or, by the formula&mdash;“for <span class =
"smallcaps">England</span>.” If preferred, with equal consistency the
arrangement may be reversed, and the Name, with or without the prefix
“for,” may precede the description: thus&mdash;“<span class =
"smallcaps">England</span>,” or “For <span class =
"smallcaps">England</span>,” three lions, &amp;c. It is to be borne in
remembrance, that armorial ensigns are personal inheritances,
and&mdash;with the exception of Sovereign Princes&mdash;by comparison
but very rarely relate to <i>Titles</i> and <i>Dignities</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Blazon, Blazoning,
Blazonry.</span>&mdash;When a knight entered the lists at a tournament,
his presence was announced by sound of trumpet or horn, after which the
officers of arms, the official Heralds, declared his armorial
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32" id = "page32"> </a>
insignia&mdash;they “blazoned” his Arms. This term, “to blazon,” derived
from the German word “<i>blasen</i>,” signifying “to blow a blast on a
horn” (or, as one eminent German Herald prefers, from the old German
word “<i>blaze</i>” or “<i>blasse</i>,” “a mark” or “sign”), in Heraldry
really denotes either to <i>describe</i> any armorial figure, device, or
composition in correct heraldic language; or to <i>represent</i> such
figure, device, or composition accurately in form, position,
arrangement, and colouring. But, as a matter of practical usage,
pictorial representation is usually allied to the word “emblazon.” The
word “blazon” also, as a noun, may be employed with a general and
comprehensive signification to denote “Heraldry.”</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Shield:&mdash;its Parts, Points, and
Divisions.</span>&mdash;Their Shield, which the knights of the Middle
Ages derived from the military usage of antiquity, and which contributed
in so important a degree to their own defensive equipment, was
considered by those armour-clad warriors to be peculiarly qualified to
display their heraldic blazonry. And, in later times, when armour had
ceased to be worn, and when shields no longer were actually used,
a&nbsp;Shield continued to be regarded as the most appropriate vehicle
for the same display. The Shield, then, which with its armorial devices
constitutes a <i>Shield of Arms</i>, always is considered to display its
blazonry upon its face or external surface. This blazoned surface of his
shield the bearer, when holding it before his person, presents (or would
present, were he so to hold it) towards those who confront him. The
right and the left sides of the person of the bearer of a Shield,
consequently, are <i>covered</i> by the right and left (in heraldic
language, the <i>dexter</i> and <i>sinister</i>) sides of his shield:
and so, from this it follows that the dexter and sinister sides of a
Shield of Arms are severally <i>opposite</i> to the left and the right
hands of all observers. The Parts and Points of an heraldic Shield,
<span class = "pagenum">33</span>

which is also entitled an “<i>Escutcheon</i>,” are thus
distinguished:&mdash;</p>

<p>No. 35. Tierced in pale (divided into three equal divisions by two

Technically this in English Heraldry is simply the representation of a
pale. (See <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Fig.’">No.</ins>&nbsp;87.)</p>

<p>To these divisions should strictly be added the further division
<i>gyronny</i> (<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Fig.’">No.</ins> 147); but neither the term <i>per</i> nor <i>parted

<p>It may be divided into any number of <i>Quarterings</i> by lines
drawn <i>per pale</i> and <i>per fesse</i>, cutting each other, as in
No. 36, which Shield is <i>quarterly of eight</i>: in like manner the
<i>Quarterings</i> of any Shield, whatever their number (which need not
be an even number), are blazoned as, <i>quarterly of twelve, &amp;c.</i>
This, to whatever extent the dividing of the Shield may be carried, is
<i>simple Quartering</i>. Again: a&nbsp;quartered Shield may have one or
more of its primary quarters, or every one of them, <i>quartered</i>:
this, which is the subdivision of a part, <i>the quartering of
quarters</i>, is <i>compound Quartering</i>: for example, in No. 37, the
Shield is first divided into the <i>four primary quarters</i>, severally
marked A, B, C, D; then, so far as the quarters A, B, D&nbsp;are
concerned,
<span class = "pagenum">35</span>
<a name = "page35" id = "page35"> </a>
the “simple quartering” is subjected to the process of “compound
quartering,” and quarters A, D&nbsp;are <i>quarters quarterly</i>, and B
is <i>a quarter quarterly of six</i>, while C remains unaffected by the
secondary process. The terms “<i>quarterly quartering</i>” and
“<i>quarterly quartered</i>” are used to signify such secondary
quartering as is exemplified in A, B, D&nbsp;of No. 37. The four primary
quarters (A, B, C, D&nbsp;of No. 37) are distinguished as <i>Grand
Quarters</i>: consequently, the quarter B of this example is the
<i>second grand quarter, quarterly of six</i>. This term “Grand Quarter”
may be employed to distinguish any primary quarter when any quarter in
the Shield is “quarterly quartered.”</p>

<p>The most beautiful forms of this Shield are represented in Nos. 40,
41, and 42: of these, No. 40 has its curves described about the sides of
an inverted equilateral triangle, and then they are prolonged by
vertical lines towards the chief: in Nos. 41, 42, the sides curve from
the chief to the base. The forms of Shields admit of various slight
modifications, to adjust them to varying conditions. Towards the close
of the fourteenth century the form of the Shield is found to undergo
some singular changes: and, at later periods, changes in form of this
kind became generally prevalent. Nos. 43, 44, exemplify such changes as
these: they also show the curved notch that was cut in the dexter chief
of the Shields of the same periods, to permit the lance

to the dexter, and others to the sinister.</p>

<p>Such a Shield as this may be consistently used in our own Heraldry:
but, since now we do not associate lances laid in rest with our heraldic
Shields, it appears desirable that we should not draw our Shields <i>à
bouche</i>. In recent Heraldry the Shield has commonly been made to
appear such an unsightly and un-heraldic deformity as is represented in
No. 45. Instead of a true heraldic Shield also, a&nbsp;rounded oval with
a convex surface, called a <i>cartouche</i>, or <i>cartouche shield</i>,
No. 46, is occasionally used for the display of armorial blazonry; or a
circle is substituted for such an oval. These cartouches probably owe
their origin to the usage of placing a Garter of the Order about a
Shield (prevalent in the fifteenth century), and to a subsequent period,
when we find the omission of the exact outline of the actual Shield. But
their frequent appearance in Ecclesiastical Heraldry suggests that
perhaps they were deliberately preferred to the purely military shield.
A&nbsp;<i>Lozenge</i>, No. 47, takes the place of a Shield to bear the
arms of Ladies, with

Treatment.</span>&mdash;When a Shield is represented as standing erect,
it is not necessary to specify that fact, since such a position may be
assumed for a Shield unless another be set forth in blazoning. Shields
are sometimes made to appear suspended by the <i>guige</i>, or
shield-belt (which was worn by Knights to sustain and secure their
Shields to their persons); in some Seals and generally in architectural
compositions, Shields-of-Arms appear suspended, erect, from their
guiges; at Westminster some of the earliest Shields are thus suspended,
with a very happy effect, from two points of suspension, the guige
passing over sculptured heads, as in No. 48, the Arms of Provence, borne
by <span class = "smallcaps">Alianore</span> of Provence, Queen of <span
class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>&mdash;the <i>shield</i> is
<i>gold</i>, and on it are blazoned <i>four red pallets</i>. In Seals,
the suspended Shield is generally represented hanging by the
sinister-chief angle, as in No. 49; and it hangs thus diagonally from
below the helm. A&nbsp;Shield thus placed is said to be “<i>couché</i>.”
This arrangement is also frequently adopted, when a Shield or an
Achievement of arms is not placed upon a Seal; but in any case the
position has no importance except as a matter of artistic treatment.</p>

<p>The entire surface of every Shield is termed the “<i>Field</i>.”
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
The same term is also applied to <i>every plain surface</i>.
A&nbsp;Shield is said to be “borne” by the personage to whom it belongs:
and, in its turn, the Shield “bears” whatever figures and devices may be
displayed upon it; whence, all these figures and devices are entitled
“<i>Bearings</i>” or “<i>Armorial Bearings</i>.” All figures and devices
are also styled “<i>Charges</i>”; and they are said to be
“<i>charged</i>” upon a Shield, Banner, or Surcoat, or upon one another.
In blazoning, the field of the Shield is always first noticed and
described: next follow the charges that rest upon the field of the
Shield itself; then descriptions are given of the secondary bearings
that are charged upon others of greater importance. As a general rule,
of several charges which all alike rest immediately upon the field of
the Shield, the most important is the first to be blazoned; so that the
arrangement of blazoning is determined by the comparative dignity of the
bearings, as well as by the degree in which charges are nearer to the
field and further from beholders. In some cases, however, a&nbsp;bearing
charged upon the field of a Shield and many times repeated on a small
scale, is blazoned (for the sake of simplicity and clearness of
expression) next to the field of the Shield itself:&mdash;thus, if a
lion be charged on the field of a Shield, and a considerable number of
crosses surround the lion, and, like him, are placed on the field of the
Shield also&mdash;the field of the Shield is blazoned first, the crosses
second, and the lion third; and, if a crescent (or other bearing) be
charged upon the lion’s shoulder, it is the last in the blazon. In
quartered Shields the blazoning commences afresh with each quartering.
In blazoning armorial banners and horse-trappings, the latter often
gorgeously enriched with heraldic blazonry, the dexter side of a flag is
always next to the staff, and the head of a horse is supposed always to
be looking towards the dexter.</p>

<p>Two other Colours, or tints of Colour, are sometimes heard
of&mdash;<i>Tenne</i>, a&nbsp;tawny or orange colour, indicated by
vertical lines crossing those of <i>Purpure</i>: and <i>Murrey</i> or
<i>Sanguine</i>, a&nbsp;dark crimson red, indicated by diagonal lines
from both dexter and sinister, crossing each other. These two are
sometimes termed stains, but their real usage was in liveries. The Furs,
Nos. 58, 59, 60, 63, 64, and 65, are of comparatively rare occurrence,
and do not appear in the best ages of Heraldry. <i>Vair</i> and
<i>Ermine</i> are common. A&nbsp;good early form of <i>Vair</i> is shown
in No. 62: and in No. 57<span class = "smallroman">A</span>, I&nbsp;give
a fine example of the treatment of <i>Ermine</i>, from the monument of
<span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span></p>

<p>In order to avoid repeating or referring to the word “<i>Or</i>,” the
word “<i>Gold</i>” is sometimes used. The Furs, Nos. 61, 62, 63, 64, and
65, are always <i>argent</i> and <i>azure</i>, unless some other metal
and colour be named in the blazoning. Animated beings and all objects,
that in Heraldry are represented in their natural aspect and colouring,
are blazoned “<i>proper</i>” abbreviated <i>ppr.</i> Heraldic charges
and compositions, when sketched in outline with pen and ink or with
pencil, and with the colours <i>written</i> thereon, are said to be
“<i>tricked</i>,” or “<i>in trick</i>.”</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Varied Fields.</span>&mdash;It is not
necessary that the Field of a Shield, or of any Bearing, should be of
any one uniform tincture: but varied surfaces are usually tinctured of
some one metal and some one colour alternating; and the patterns or
devices thus produced are generally derived (the Furs, Nos. 61-65, which
are good examples of varied surfaces, being the exceptions) from the
forms of the original simple charges that are distinguished as
<i>Ordinaries</i> and <i>Subordinaries.</i> And these varied surfaces or
fields are always <i>flat</i>; the whole of their devices or patterns
are <i>level</i>, their

to denote relief.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Law of Tinctures.</span>&mdash;Every
charge is supposed to rest upon the field of a Shield, or on the surface
of some charge. It is a strict rule, that a charge of a metal must rest
upon a field that is of a colour or fur; or, contrariwise, that a charge
of a colour must rest on a field that is of a metal or fur,&mdash;that
is, that <i>metal be not on metal, nor colour on colour</i>. This rule
is modified in the case of <i>varied fields</i>, upon which may be
charged a bearing of either a metal or a colour: also, a&nbsp;partial
relaxation of the rule is conceded when one bearing is charged upon
another, should the conditions of any particular case require such a
concession. This rule does not apply to bordures, nor very stringently
to augmentations or crests, and it is not so rigidly enforced in Foreign
as in British Heraldry. There are, of course, a&nbsp;few exceptions, but
they are not numerous, the one usually instanced as an intentional
violation being the <i>silver</i> armorial Shield of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Crusader Kings</span> of <span class =
"smallcaps">Jerusalem</span>, No. 69, upon which <i>five golden
crosses</i> are charged; the motive in this remarkable exception to an
established rule being said to be to cause this Shield to
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
be unlike that of any other potentate. What may be termed the
accessories of a charge are not included in this law of tinctures: thus,
a&nbsp;silver lion having a red tongue may be charged on a blue shield,
and the red tongue may rest on the blue field of the Shield.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Counterchanging</span> is dividing the
field of a Shield in such a manner that it is, <i>e.g.</i> in part of a
metal and in part of a colour, and then arranging the charges in such a
manner that they shall be reciprocally of the same colour and metal:
thus, the shield of John Fenwick, No. 70 (R.&nbsp;2)
is,&mdash;<i>per-fesse gu. and arg., six martlets, three, two, one,
counterchanged</i>; that is, the field is red in chief and silver in
base, and the birds or parts of the birds on the red field are silver,
and those on the silver field are red.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Diapering.</span>&mdash;This term denotes a
system of decorating plain surfaces in various ways, which was in great
favour with the early heraldic artists. In the use of Diaper, which is
often desirable when artistic reasons suggest its suitability, care must
be taken that the decorative designs and patterns do not in any way
admit of their being mistaken for charges. This diaper may be executed
in low relief, subordinated to the relief of the charges; and it is not
required to yield any obedience to the law of tinctures. In the Shield,
<a href = "#fig68">No. 68</a> (the original, a&nbsp;very noble shield,
is at Castle Acre Priory, Norfolk), which is simply <i>chequée</i>, the
Diapering may be alternately azure and or on the squares that are
alternately or and azure; or the Diaper may be
<span class = "pagenum">45</span>
<a name = "page45" id = "page45"> </a>
dark blue, or sable, or argent on the azure squares, and on the golden
ones whatever the artist might consider would be most effective; but the
Diaper, in this and in all other examples, must always be subordinate to
the area and tincture of the field. The finest known early example of
heraldic Diaper in enamel, is the Shield of <span class =
"smallcaps">William de Valence</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Pembroke</span>, in Westminster Abbey, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1296. Very beautiful early examples of
Diapering have been preserved in relics of heraldic stained glass.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Disposition: Blazoning.</span>&mdash;By
<i>Disposition</i> is understood the placing and arranging of charges.
A&nbsp;single important charge, which has not a fixed position of its
own, is placed in the centre of any composition: and minor charges are
arranged in their most natural and consistent order and positions, any
deviation from which must be specified. A&nbsp;single charge, many times
repeated, and small in size, whether with or without any special orderly
disposition, is said to be <i>Semée</i>&mdash;strewn, that is, or
scattered over the field, as seed is sown by the hand; or, if the
charges are very small or very numerous, the term <i>poudrée</i> or
<i>powdered</i> has sometimes been used. The expression&mdash;“<i>three,
two, one</i>,” signifies that a charge is repeated six times, the
Disposition
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page46" id = "page46"> </a>
being three in a horizontal row towards the chief of the Shield, then
two in a similar row in the centre, and one in base. In the same manner,
the expressions&mdash;“<i>four, four, one</i>,” “<i>four, three, two,
one</i>,” “<i>three and one</i>,” &amp;c., are used as occasion may
require. For other dispositions of charges other appropriate terms will
present themselves to our notice, growing out of our subject as it
advances.</p>

<p>Should a <i>Tincture</i> or a <i>Number</i> occur a second time in
blazoning a single composition, it must be indicated, not by repeating
the word already used, but by reference to it. Thus, if the tincture of
the field should occur a second time, reference is made to it in the
formula&mdash;“<i>of the field</i>:” or, perhaps more
frequently&mdash;“<i>of the first</i>;” or, if the tincture that is
named second in order in the blazoning be repeated, it is indicated by
the expression&mdash;“<i>of the second</i>;” and so on. Again: should
there be three fleurs de lys and also three crescents in one and the
same composition, having specified the “three fleurs de lys,” the number
of the crescents would be set forth in the words&mdash;“<i>as many</i>
crescents:” providing nothing else has in the wording of the blazon
intervened in such a way as to cause uncertainty by the use of the term;
and so, in like manner, with any other numbers of these or of any other
charges.</p>

<p>In descriptive Blazoning, Epithets, which follow their own Nouns,
precede the Tinctures that are associated with those nouns: thus,
a&nbsp;black rampant lion having golden claws is blazoned,&mdash;<i>a
lion rampt. sa., armed or</i>. In written and printed blazoning, the
arrangement of the words and the placing the stops are alike matters of
supreme importance. The sentences are to be short. A&nbsp;comma is to
mark the end of each complete minor clause or division of a sentence:
a&nbsp;colon, each more important clause. A&nbsp;point or period is to
follow every abbreviated word, to mark the fact of the abbreviation, but
without affecting the additional
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page47" id = "page47"> </a>
presence of a comma (as in the blazoning, “<i>a lion rampant sa.</i>,”)
or of a colon, as the case may be; but a second period is unnecessary.
It is a very common error to overload heraldic blazoning with commas
which, instead of aiding to simplify the sentences, obscure the meaning
and perplex the reader. It is always correct to write&mdash;“<i>three
lion’s heads</i>,” “<i>six pilgrim’s staves</i>,” &amp;c.: and always
incorrect to write&mdash;“<i>three lions’ heads</i>,” “<i>six pilgrims’
staves</i>,” &amp;c.; but it is a point printers have an apparently
invincible objection to accept.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Emblazoning in Tinctures.</span>&mdash;On
this head I must be content to offer to students only a few brief
practical observations. The metal <i>Gold</i> may be rendered with gold
prepared in small saucers, or (most advantageously) in minute slabs;
this preparation is applied, like a common water-colour, by moistening
the gold with water; and it is desirable previously to have washed the
paper, card (or vellum) with diluted white of egg. Gold leaf may also be
used, but the process is tedious, and requires both skill and experience
to ensure complete success. Yellow paint, again, may be used to
represent the metal, the best colours being <i>cadmium yellow</i>, or
“<i>aureolin</i>” (Winsor and Newton) mixed with <i>Chinese white</i>.
For shading, <i>carmine</i>, or <i>crimson lake</i>, mixed with gum. For
<i>Silver</i>, <i>aluminium</i> may be used with excellent effect; or
<i>Chinese white</i>; or the paper may be left white: for shading,
<i>grey</i> (<i>blue</i> and <i>Indian ink</i> mixed) and gum. The
Aluminium is prepared, like the gold, in minute slabs: it may be
obtained, of great excellence, from Messrs. Winsor &amp; Newton, by whom
also a very pure preparation of gold is sold; but both the gold and the
aluminium slabs are sold by all good artists’ colourmen. These Metals
may be diapered, as well as burnished, with an agate-burnisher.</p>

<p>For <i>Azure</i>:&mdash;<i>French blue</i>, freely mixed with
<i>Chinese white</i> and a very little gum, the colour to be laid on
thick:
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
shade with <i>Prussian blue</i> mixed with a larger proportion of gum.
For <i>Gules</i>:&mdash;<i>Orange vermilion</i> either pure, or mixed
with a very little <i>cadmium yellow</i> or <i>Chinese white</i>, and
still less gum: (never use a brilliant but most treacherous preparation
known as “pure scarlet:”) shade with <i>carmine</i> or <i>crimson
lake</i>, and gum. For <i>Vert</i>:&mdash;<i>emerald green</i>, with
<i>Chinese white</i> and a little gum: shade with dark green, made from
mixing <i>aureolin</i> (or <i>gamboge</i>) with <i>Prussian blue</i> and
gum. For <i>Purpure</i>:&mdash;mix <i>carmine</i> and <i>French
blue</i>, with a little gum: shade with a darker tint of the same. For
<i>Sable</i>:&mdash;Very dark <i>grey</i>, made by mixing a little
<i>Chinese white</i> and gum with black: shade with black and more
gum.</p>

<p>When the Metals are rendered by gold and aluminium, it is desirable
that these tinctures should be applied, and that the diapering and
burnishing of the Metals should also be completed with the burnisher,
before the adjoining colours are laid on. The burnishing may be executed
in two or three hours after the Metals have been applied to the paper;
and the paper should be placed upon a piece of glass during the
processes of burnishing and diapering.</p>

<p>A&nbsp;Fesse or Bar, when placed between two similar figures narrower
than barrulets, is said to be <i>cotised</i> by them; or, to be “doubly

cotised</i> (or, <i>between two bars gemelles</i>) <i>az.</i>

“<i>barry</i>,” the number of the bars in every case to be
specified&mdash;as, “<i>barry of six</i>,” “<i>barry of eight</i>,”
&amp;c. If the number of bars exceeds <i>eight</i> (some writers say
<i>ten</i>), it is “<i>barrulée</i>” or “<i>barruly</i>”; and in this
case it is not necessary that the number of the bars should be
specified, the word <i>barrulée</i> being used alone, or the expression
“<i>barrulée sans nombre</i>” to denote a considerable number, but not a
fixed number of bars&mdash;the number, however, always to be
<i>even</i>. But this is a modern refinement of blazon to which little
if any attention was paid in early days. It is to be observed that while
the bars, whatever their number, if they are blazoned as bars, are to be
treated as if they were executed in relief upon the field of a Shield,
a&nbsp;Shield that is barry or barrulée has its field formed by bars
which are all in the same plane. Examples:&mdash;<i>Barry of six or and

<p>A Cross having a narrow border lying in the same plane with itself,
is “fimbriated,” such a border being a “<i>fimbriation</i>”: thus, No.
89, <i>Az., a&nbsp;cross gu., fimbriated arg.</i>, represents the Cross
of St. George in our National “Union Jack.” <!-- also (cough, cough) the
flag of Norway --> A&nbsp;Cross having its four extremities cut off
square, so that it does not extend in any direction to the border-lines
of the shield, is “<i>couped</i>” or “<i>humettée</i>”. If the
extremities of a Cross are cut off to points, it is “<i>pointed</i>,” as
in No. 90.
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page55" id = "page55"> </a>
If its central area is entirely removed, so that but little more than
its outlines remain, it is “<i>voided</i>,” or (H.&nbsp;3) “<i>a false
Cross</i>” (“faux croix”): when its four limbs are <i>equal</i> in
length, it is a “<i>Greek Cross</i>,” as No. 91: when the limbs are
<i>unequal</i>, the lower limb or shaft being longer than the other
three, as in No. 92, it is a “<i>Latin Cross</i>” or a “long cross”: but
neither of these two last terms are used regarding the plain cross
throughout, notwithstanding that differences in the shape of the shield
may materially alter the proportion of the limbs. If a cross be formed
of a shaft and two horizontal limbs only (like the letter&nbsp;T), as in
No. 93, it is a “<i>Tau Cross</i>,” or “<i>Cross Tau</i>”: if it is
pierced at the intersection of the limbs, and the entire central area be
voided, it is said to be “<i>pierced quarterly</i>.” A&nbsp;Latin Cross
on steps, is “<i>on Degrees</i>,” and it is distinguished as a “Calvary
Cross.” Charges having a cruciform arrangement are “<i>in
Cross</i>.”</p>

<p>The Cross <i>Patée</i> or <i>Formée</i> is represented in No. 106.
No. 107 is the “<i>Cross of eight Points</i>,” or the <i>Maltese</i>
Cross: this example is drawn from the portrait of <span class =
"smallcaps">Phillippe de Villiers de L’Isle-Adam</span>, elected
forty-third Grand Master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1521; this picture is in the possession
of the Earl of Clarendon, K.G. The Cross <i>Potent</i>, No. 108. The
Cross <i>Avellane</i>, No. 109. The <i>Crossed-Crosslet</i>, and the
Crosses <i>Patée</i>, <i>Botonée</i>, and <i>Potent</i>, are also drawn
having their shaft elongated and <i>pointed at the base</i>: in this
form they are severally blazoned as a “<i>Crossed-Crosslet Fitchée</i>”
(or <i>fitched</i>), a&nbsp;“<i>Cross Patée
<span class = "pagenum">58</span>
<a name = "page58" id = "page58"> </a>
Fitchée</i>,” &amp;c.,&mdash;a Cross, that is, “<i>fixable</i>” in the
ground; No. 110 is an example of a Cross <i>Botonée Fitchée</i>. Several
of these varieties of the heraldic Cross occur but rarely; and there are
other somewhat fanciful varieties so little in use, as to render any
description of them unnecessary. The student of mediæval monumental
antiquities will not fail to observe a certain degree of resemblance
between some of the Crosses of Heraldry, and those that are incised and
sculptured on sepulchral slabs.</p>

<p>The Diminutives of the Bend are the <i>Bendlet</i> and the
<i>Cotise</i>, the one containing one-half and the other one-fourth of
its area. A&nbsp;Cotise is sometimes borne singly, when it is a
<i>Riband</i>. A&nbsp;bendlet <i>couped</i> is a baton. A&nbsp;Bend

narrow, evidently to give more space for the lioncels. Charges displayed

the Bend to be set vertically and to become a Pale: thus, another <span

charges upon a Bend. Charges set diagonally on the field of a Shield, in
the position in which a bend would occupy, are said to be “<i>in

possible to have three or more charges each disposed bendwise; but yet,
nevertheless, when taken together occupying the position of a fesse and
therefore described also as in fesse. This distinction between charges
bendwise (or bendways) and charges in bend should be carefully

<span class = "smallcaps">The Subordinaries.</span> This title has been
assigned, but without any decisive authority, to another group of
devices, second in rank to the Ordinaries. Very few writers agree as to
which are ordinaries and which subordinaries; nor does there seem any
reason why any distinction between them should exist. Nor, indeed, save
that all are exclusively heraldic, why some of them should be regarded
as anything more than ordinary charges. These Subordinaries are the
<i>Canton</i>, the <i>Quarter</i>, the <i>Inescutcheon</i>, the
<i>Orle</i>, the <i>Tressure</i>, the <i>Bordure</i>, <i>Flanches</i>,
the <i>Lozenge</i>, <i>Mascle</i> and <i>Rustre</i>, the <i>Fusil</i>,
the <i>Billet</i>, the <i>Gyron</i>, and the <i>Frette</i>. The Canton,
by the early Heralds commonly styled the “Quarter,” sometimes has been
grouped with the Ordinaries. And it must here be observed that the
Lozenge, Fusil, Billet, Gyron, and Frette were not used as single
charges by the early Heralds; but by them the fields of Shields were
divided <i>lozengy</i> and <i>gyronny</i>, or they were <i>semée of
Billets</i>, or covered over with <i>Frette</i>-work, from which the
single charges evidently were afterwards obtained.</p>

cut off by two lines, the one drawn in pale and the other bar-wise, or
in fesse, is either the first quarter of the field of a Shield, or about
three-fourths of that quarter, but smaller if not charged. The confusion
between the canton and the quarter is due to the fact that ancient arms
in which the charge is now, and has been for centuries past, stereotyped
as a canton and drawn to occupy one-ninth of the Shield, were uniformly
drawn and blazoned in early times with the charge as a quarter. But
there is a marked distinction now made between the canton and the
quarter. A&nbsp;<i>Canton ermine</i> is of frequent occurrence, as in
No. 128; but it is generally borne charged, and it always overlies the
charges of the field of the Shield, as No. 129, for <span class =

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Orle</span> (H. 3), blazoned by early
Heralds as a “<i>false escutcheon</i>” (“<i>faux escocheon</i>”), or as
an “<i>inescutcheon voided</i>,” is the border of a Shield or
Escutcheon&mdash;a Shield, that is, voided of the central area of its
field, and, like an Inescutcheon, charged on a Shield. The arms of <span
class = "smallcaps">Balliol</span>, No. 134, are&mdash;<i>Gu., an Orle
arg.</i> (H.&nbsp;3). These arms are blazoned on many Scottish Seals of
the greatest interest, and on the Seals of Balliol College, Oxford.
Small charges are frequently disposed about the border of a Shield
“<i>in Orle</i>,” as in <a href = "#fig86">Nos. 86</a> and 132.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Tressure</span> (H. 3) may be regarded
as a variety of the Orle; indeed, in its simplest form it is a very
narrow Orle, which is generally set round with fleurs de lys.
A&nbsp;Tressure thus enriched is represented in No. 135: in this example
all the heads of the fleurs de lys point externally, and all their
stalks internally, and this accordingly is blazoned as a “<i>Tressure
flory</i>.” In No. 136, which, like No. 135, is a single Tressure, the
fleurs de lys are so disposed that the heads and stalks of the flowers
point alternately in contrary directions: this is blazoned as a
“<i>Tressure flory counterflory</i>.” From this last example the
Tressure that is so well known in the blazonry of the Royal Shield of
<span class = "smallcaps">Scotland</span> differs, in being
“<i>double</i>.” This, the double
<span class = "pagenum">67</span>
<a name = "page67" id = "page67"> </a>
Tressure of Scotland, is a combination of two such single Tressures as
No. 136, and it is produced from them in the manner
following:&mdash;From one such single Tressure, as No. 136, all the
alternate heads and stalks of the fleurs de lys that point internally
are cut away and removed; then a second similar Tressure, of rather
smaller size, is denuded of all its external adornment, and in that
condition it is placed within the former Tressure, leaving a narrow
interval between the two.</p>

<p>Each component half of this “double Tressure flory counterflory,”
accordingly, has its own independent series of demi-fleurs de lys, the
stalks and heads of the flowers alternating, and the one alternate
series pointing externally, while the other points internally. When in
combination, these two series of demi-fleurs de lys must be so arranged
that the heads of the flowers in one series correspond with their stalks
in the other, as in No. 137. I&nbsp;am thus particular in describing the
process of producing the Royal Tressure, because it is frequently to be
seen incorrectly drawn. No. 138, the Royal Shield of <span class =

will be observed that a narrow strip of the golden field of this Shield
intervenes between the two Tressures. There are many fine examples of

1577). Mr. Seton (“Scottish Heraldry,” p. 447) states that the Tressure
may be borne “triple”; and, after specifying the Scottish families upon
whose Shields the same honourable bearing is blazoned, he
adds:&mdash;“In the coat of the Marquess of <span class =
"smallcaps">Huntly</span>, the Tressure is flowered with fleurs de lys
within, and adorned with <i>crescents</i> without; while in that of the
Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Aberdeen</span> it is flowered and
counter-flowered with <i>thistles</i>, <i>roses</i>, and fleurs de lys
alternately.”</p>

<i>Flanches</i> are formed by two curved lines issuing from the chief,
one on each side of the Shield: they are shown, shaded for azure, in No.
141; and in No. 142 are their Diminutives, <i>Flasques</i> or
<i>Voiders</i>, shaded for gules. But these diminutives are hardly ever
met with. There is a close resemblance between these charges and a
peculiar dress worn by Ladies of rank in the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries; but it is not easy to determine whether the dress suggested
the Flanches on the Shield, or was derived from them. One thing,
however, is certain&mdash;the dress must have possessed very decided
good qualities, since it continued in favour for more than two
centuries. It is remarkable that many of the ancient Greek Shields have
pierced Flanches.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Gyron</span>, a triangular figure, not
known in English blazon as a separate charge (except perhaps in the one
case of the arms of Mortimer), gives its title to the <i>gyronny

than of the South. The field gyronny generally, and more particularly in
Scotland, is divided into <i>eight pieces</i>: but the divisions are

<i>Pomme</i> is vert: and the <i>Golpe</i> is purpure. These distinctive
titles, which are more calculated to perplex the student than to
simplify his study, are of comparatively recent origin, the early
Heralds having used the terms “<i>Bezant</i>,” “<i>Plate</i>,” and
“<i>Torteau</i>,” with the general designations “<i>Roundle</i>” and

<span class = "firstword">Thus</span>, in his own quaint fashion, the
enthusiastic old Herald of the seventeenth century indicates the number
and variety of the Charges, which in process of time had been introduced
into Armory even before his era. In earlier days the Charges of Heraldry
were much less varied, comparatively few in their numbers, and generally
of a simple character. It will readily be understood, however, that
fresh figures and devices would continually appear in blazon; and also
that these, in their turn, would lead the way for the introduction of
further varieties and new modifications.</p>

<p>Human Beings are of very rare occurrence, except as Supporters. Parts
of the human frame constantly appear, but they are more generally borne
as Crests upon helms than as charges on shields. “Moor’s heads” or
“Saracen’s heads” appear in some coats, with arms, hands and legs: and a
human heart is well known as a charge in the coat of

<p>The Shield of the ancient kingdom of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Isle of Man</span>, No. 158, still continues to be the
heraldic ensign of that island: it is&mdash;<i>Gu., three human legs in
armour ppr., conjoined in the fesse-point at the upper part of the
thighs, and flexed in triangle.</i> This true curiosity of Heraldry
leads Mr. Planché to remark, that “the <i>arms</i> of <span class =
"smallcaps">Man</span> are <i>legs</i>” (“Pursuivant of Arms,” p. 112).
The Shield represented in No. 158 is drawn from an original example of
the age of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span> in the
Heralds’ College. At later periods, the armour of the conjoined limbs is
represented
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
in conformity with the usages then prevalent, and golden spurs are
added. The ancient symbol of the island of Sicily, in which the limbs
are without either armour or clothing, has been represented in <a href =
"#fig10">No. 10</a>: this device also appears in ancient examples with a
human head at the junction of the limbs. Three human arms, united in the

No. 159.&mdash; Shield of St. Alban’s Abbey (partly restored).</p>

<p>Human figures, winged and vested, and designed to represent <span
class = "smallcaps">Angels</span>, are occasionally introduced in
English Heraldry, their office generally being to act as “Supporters” to
armorial Shields. Fine examples, in admirable preservation, may be seen
boldly sculptured in the noble timber-roof of Westminster Hall; also in
panels over the principal entrance to the Hall, and in various parts of
the Abbey of Westminster. In the grand Abbey Church of St. Alban at St.
Alban’s, numerous other examples of great excellence yet remain, the
works of Abbot John de Wheathamstede, about <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1440. In No. 159 I give a representation of the
Shield of Arms of the Abbey of <span class = "smallcaps">St.
Alban</span>&mdash;<i>Az., a
<span class = "pagenum">76</span>
<a name = "page76" id = "page76"> </a>
saltire or</i>, supported by Angels, and the Shield ensigned by the
Mitre of Abbot Thomas De la Mere, as it is represented in his noble
Brass in the Abbey Church. The Shield and the Angel Figures are the work
of Abbot John. The Heads of the Figures, which are destroyed in the
original, are restored from stained glass of the same period in the
Abbey Church. Figures of Angels holding Shields of Arms&mdash;each
figure having a shield in front of its breast, are frequently sculptured
as corbels in Gothic churches.</p>

<p>In the earliest Rolls of Arms, the Lion is the only animal that is
found in blazon, with the sole addition of Boar’s heads. Deer, dogs,
bulls, calves, rams, and a few other animals subsequently appear to
share heraldic service and honours with the king of beasts. In modern
Armory, however, almost every living creature has been required to
discharge such duties as Heralds have been pleased to assign to them.
The Lion of Heraldry I leave to be considered, with the Eagle, in the
next Chapter. In comparatively early blazon, the <i>Bear</i> is borne by
<span class = "smallcaps">Fitz Urse</span>: the <i>Calf</i>, by <span

<p>With the lordly Eagle a few other Birds are associated in early
Heraldry: and, after a while, others join them, including the Falcon,
Ostrich, Swan, Peacock or Pawne, and the Pelican borne both as a symbol
of sacred significance, and also by the <span class =

bird, however,
<span class = "pagenum">77</span>
<a name = "page77" id = "page77"> </a>
of the early Heralds is the Martlet, the heraldic Martin, a&nbsp;near
relative of the Swallow or <i>Hirondelle</i>. The Martlet is practically
always represented in profile, at rest, and with its wings closed. The
few exceptions are modern. In some early examples the feet are shown, as
in No. 160: but, in the Shield of Earl <span class = "smallcaps">Wm. de
Valence</span> in Westminster Abbey, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1296, the Martlet appears feetless, as in No.
161; and at a later period this mode of representation was generally
adopted. French Heralds deprive their Martlets of beak as well as
feet.</p>

<p>“As the symbol of a name,” writes Mr. Moule, “almost all Fish have
been used in Heraldry; and in many instances Fish have been assumed in
Arms in reference to the produce of the estate, giving to the quaint
device a twofold interest” (“Heraldry of Fish,” p 13). The earliest
examples are the Barbel, the Dolphin, the Luce (or Pike), the Herring,
and the Roach. In conjunction with fish we may perhaps consider the
Escallop which, as a charge, belongs to the earliest period of Heraldry.
The Barbel, so named from the barbs attached to its mouth to assist it
in its search for food, was introduced into English Heraldry by <span

<p>Reptiles and Insects occur but rarely in English Heraldry. Bees,

<p>Imaginary and Fabulous Beings, some of them the creations of heraldic

Shields, or they are borne independently as Badges. A&nbsp;very brief
description (all that is necessary) of the greater number of these
monsters of <i>un</i>natural history will be given in the “Glossary of
heraldic terms,” in <a href = "#chapX">Chapter X.</a>; consequently, it
is enough here merely to refer to them as having a place in blazon. The
Griffin or Gryphon, the most worthy of the group, is comparatively
common. The Dragon and the Wivern or Wyvern, both of them winged
monsters, differ in this respect, that the former has four legs, while
the latter has two only. In early blazon this distinction was not always
observed. The Cockatrice, always having two legs, is a Wyvern with a
cock’s head.</p>

<p>Natural Objects of all kinds are blazoned as Charges of Heraldry, and
they will be found described and illustrated in their proper places in
<a href = "#chapX">Chapter X.</a> They include the <i>Sun</i>, the
<i>Moon</i>, the <i>Stars</i>; also such terrestrial objects as
<i>Trees</i>, <i>Flowers</i>, <i>Fruits</i>, <i>Sheaves and Ears of
Corn</i>, <i>Leaves</i>, <i>Chaplets</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> And with these
Charges I may group the always beautiful Fleur de Lys, and the Trefoil,
Quatrefoil, Cinquefoil, and Sixfoil.</p>

<p>Of the various Artificial Figures and Devices that

Heralds have charged upon Shields of Arms, it will be unnecessary for me
to give detailed descriptions, except when either the heraldic name may
require explanation, or some special circumstances connected with any
particular figure or device may impart to it peculiar claims for
attention. Again I refer to the “Glossary” for notices and examples of
all Charges of this class&mdash;Annulets, Buckles, Castles, Crowns,
Cups, Horseshoes, Keys, Knots, Sickles, Stirrups, Trumpets, and many

<p>In blazoning Charges of various classes, Heralds employ
<i>appropriate Epithets and descriptive Terms</i>, of which the
following are characteristic examples:&mdash;The <i>Sun</i> is “<i>in
splendour</i>.” The <i>Moon</i>, when full, is “<i>in her
complement</i>”: she is a “<i>Crescent</i>” when she appears in No. 166,
<span class = "smallroman">A</span>: she is “<i>Increscent</i>” when as
in No. 166, <span class = "smallroman">B</span>: and she is
“<i>Decrescent</i>” when as in No. 166, <span class =
"smallroman">C</span>. Animals and Birds of prey are said to be
“<i>armed</i>” of their talons, teeth, and claws. All horned animals,
also, except Stags and Antelopes, are “<i>armed</i>” of their horns; and
a Cock is “<i>armed</i>” of his spurs; whilst Griffins and birds of prey
are “<i>armed</i>” of their beaks and claws (<i>i.e.</i> the part of the
leg which is unfeathered). Animals are “<i>hoofed</i>” or
“<i>unguled</i>” of their hoofs; and “<i>langued</i>” of their tongues.
Fierce animals are “<i>vorant</i>” of their prey, when represented in
the act of devouring it. Deer, when reposing, are “<i>lodged</i>”
<a href = "#fig25">Nos. 25</a> and <a href = "#fig26">26</a>: when
standing, and looking out from the Shield, No. 167, “<i>at gaze</i>”:
when in easy motion, they are termed “<i>trippant</i>,” or sometimes the
word “<i>tripping</i>” is substituted, No. 168: and when in
<span class = "pagenum">81</span>
<a name = "page81" id = "page81"> </a>
rapid motion, they are “<i>courant</i>,” “<i>at speed</i>,” or sometimes
described as “<i>in full course</i>,” No. 169. The male Stag is
sometimes termed a “<i>Hart</i>,” and the female a “<i>Hind</i>.” There
is really a distinction between the Buck and the Stag, but it is very
usually disregarded in Heraldry. The antlers of the Hart are
“<i>Attires</i>,” their branches are “<i>Tynes</i>”; and they are said
to be “<i>attired</i>” of their antlers. A&nbsp;Stag’s head full-faced,
but without the neck, as No. 170, is “<i>cabossed</i>” or
“<i>caboshed</i>.”</p>

<p>Eagles and Hawks with expanded wings, as in <ins class = "correction"

“<i>rising</i>”; when in flight, they are “<i>volant</i>”; when at rest,

A&nbsp;Peacock having its tail expanded is “<i>in its pride</i>”; and

himself, would naturally secure for him a position of corresponding
eminence in Heraldry. From the dawn of the heraldic era, accordingly,
the Lion is blazoned on the Shields of Sovereigns, Princes, and Nobles.
The tressured Lion has been already noticed upon the Royal Shield of
<span class = "smallcaps">Scotland</span>, <a href = "#fig138">No.
138</a>; and a crowned Lion has also appeared in the same attitude,
borne by an English Prince, <span class = "smallcaps">Richard</span>,
Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Cornwall</span>, <a href =
"#fig140">No. 140</a>. From the time that they first possessed any true
armorial insignia, the Sovereigns of the Realm of <span class =
"smallcaps">England</span> have borne Lions upon their Royal Shield.
A&nbsp;Lion was the Ensign of the Native Princes of <span class =
"smallcaps">Wales</span>, as he was of the Kings of <span class =
"smallcaps">Leon</span>, of <span class = "smallcaps">Norway</span>, and
of <span class = "smallcaps">Denmark</span>, and of the Counts of <span
class = "smallcaps">Holland</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Hainault</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Eu</span>,
&amp;c. And, in like manner, the Lion was in high favour with the most
noble and powerful Barons of England&mdash;the <span class =
"smallcaps">Mowbrays</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Bohuns</span>,
<span class = "smallcaps">Longespees</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Fitz-Alans</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Lacies</span>,
<span class = "smallcaps">Percies</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Segraves</span>, and such as they.</p>

<p>It was a necessary consequence of his great popularity
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
that the Lion of Heraldry should be blazoned in various attitudes, and
also variously tinctured, otherwise it would not be possible duly to
distinguish the Lions of different Shields. Heralds of all countries
appear readily to have permitted their Lions to lay aside their natural
tawny hue, and in its stead to assume the heraldic <i>or</i>,
<i>argent</i>, <i>azure</i>, <i>gules</i>, and <i>sable</i>; but
Continental Heralds were not generally disposed to recognise in their
Lions any other attitude than the one which they held to be consistent
with their Lion character, instincts, and habits&mdash;erect, that is,
with one hind paw only on the ground, looking forward towards their
prey, so as to show but one eye, and evidently in the act of preparing
to spring. This undoubtedly most characteristic attitude is
<i>rampant</i>, <a href = "#fig171">No. 171</a>: and only when he was in
this rampant attitude did the early Heralds consider any Lion to be a
Lion, and blazon him by his true name. A&nbsp;Lion walking and looking
about him, the early Heralds held to be acting the part of a leopard:
consequently, when he was in any such attitude, they blazoned him as
“<i>a leopard</i>.” The animal bearing that name bore it simply as an
heraldic title, which distinguished a Lion in a particular attitude.
These heraldic “leopards” were drawn in every respect as other heraldic
“lions,” without spots or any leopard<i>ish</i> distinction whatever.
This explains the usage, retained till late in the fourteenth century,
which assigned to the Lions of the Royal Shield of England the name of
“leopards.” They were so called, not by the enemies of England for
derision and insult, as some persons, in their ignorance of early
Heraldry, have been pleased both to imagine and to assert; but the
English Kings and Princes, who well knew their “Lions” to be Lions, in
blazon styled them “leopards,” because they also knew that Lions in the
attitude of their “Lions” were heraldic “leopards.” When at length the
necessity of varying the attitude of their Lions was admitted by all
Heralds, in consequence of the greatly increased numbers
<span class = "pagenum">85</span>
<a name = "page85" id = "page85"> </a>
of the bearers of Lions, some strict adherents to the original
distinctive nomenclature blazoned any Lion that was <i>not rampant</i>
by the compound term of a “<i>lion-leopard</i>,” or a
“<i>lion-leopardé</i>.” But that controversy has long been at rest.</p>

<p>The following terms are now in use to denote the various attitudes of
the Lion in Heraldry:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rampant</i>: erect, one hind paw on the ground, the other three
paws elevated, the animal looking forward and having his tail elevated,
No. 171. <i>Rampant Guardant</i>: as before, but looking out from the
Shield, No. 172. <i>Rampant Reguardant</i>: as before, but looking
backwards.</p>

<p><i>Passant</i>: walking, three paws on the ground, the dexter
fore-paw being elevated, looking forward, the tail displayed over the
back, No. 173. <i>Passant Guardant</i>: as before, but looking out from
the Shield, No. 174. <i>Passant Reguardant</i>: as before, but looking
backwards.</p>

the authority of many Shields of the same form. A&nbsp;red Shield

<p>Lions also fulfil important duties of high honour in English Heraldry

the time of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> a Crowned
Lion, at the first standing on a Cap of Estate, and afterwards upon the

Crest of <span class = "smallcaps">Scotland</span> (see <a href =

England, in like manner, have always borne the Royal Lion distinguished
by some “Mark of Cadency” (see

<p>As a Royal Supporter of the Arms of <i>England</i>, the Lion appears
in company with some other creature from the time of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VI.</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;IV.</span> sometimes having his Shield supported
by two Lions. On the accession of <span class =
"smallcaps">James&nbsp;I.</span> of Great Britain, the Royal Lion
Supporter formed that alliance with the Unicorn of Scotland which still
continues, and will continue, it is to be hoped, throughout all time.
Lions, as I shall point out more in detail in <a href =
"#chapXVI">Chapter XVI.</a>, were frequently introduced into the
composition of Seals before true heraldic Supporters were in use. In
more recent Heraldry the Lion is a favourite Supporter: he now appears
supporting the Shields of the Dukes of <span class =

<i>rampant</i>, <i>rampant reguardant</i>, and <i>sejant rampant</i>.
Lions also, and Demi-Lions, are frequently borne as modern Crests.</p>

<p>In our own treatment of the Lions of Heraldry, whatever their
attitude or tincture, whatever also the position they may occupy or the
heraldic duty they may discharge, we are always to draw and to blazon
them as true <i>heraldic Lions</i>, while, at the same time, in their
expression and general characteristics they are to be <i>genuine
Lions</i>.</p>

<p>In becoming fellowship with the Lion, the <span class =
"smallcaps">Eagle</span> appears in the earliest English Rolls and
examples of Arms. The Royal bird, however, does not occur in English
blazon so frequently as the Lion; and his appearance often denotes an
alliance with German Princes. A&nbsp;Roll of Arms (printed in
“Archæologia,” XXX.) of the year 1275 commences with the Shields of the
“<span class = "smallcaps">Emperor of Germany</span>,” and of the “<span
class = "smallcaps">King of Germany</span>,” which are severally
blazoned as,&mdash;“<i>Or, an Eagle displayed having two heads sa.</i>,”
and, “<i>Or, an Eagle displayed sable</i>.” In York Cathedral, in
stained glass, there are Shields with both the double-headed and the
single-headed Eagles, all of them German, which may be considered to
have been executed before the year 1310. In the north choir-aisle at
Westminster, the Shield (now mutilated) of the Emperor <span class =
"smallcaps">Frederick&nbsp;II.</span> is boldly sculptured by an
heraldic artist of the time of our <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>, No. 200; here the Eagle had one head
only. The German Emperors naturally adopted the Eagle for their heraldic
Ensign, in support of their claim to be successors to the Roman Cæsars;
and the Russian Czars, with the same motive, have also assumed the same
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
ensign. The Eagle having two heads, which severally look to the dexter
and the sinister, as in No. 201, typified a rule that claimed to extend
over both the Eastern and the Western Empires; as the Eagle with a
single head, No. 202, might be considered to have a less comprehensive
signification. The Eagles of the Princes of Germany are frequently to be
found, blazoned for them, in England.</p>

an heraldic usage of striking significance, and it also illustrates the
early existence of the sentiment which at a later period led to the
adoption of “Supporters” to Shields of Arms. In the early Heraldry of
Scotland, a&nbsp;single displayed Eagle is occasionally found supporting
an armorial Shield; as in the Seals of <span class =

1296, and <span class = "smallcaps">William</span>, Earl of <span class

<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1378 (Seton’s “Scottish
Heraldry,” Plates VIII. and XII.): sometimes also, as Mr. Seton has
observed, “the Eagle’s breast is charged with more than one Shield, as
in the case of the Seals of <span class = "smallcaps">Margaret
Stewart</span>, Countess of <span class = "smallcaps">Angus</span>
(1366), and <span class = "smallcaps">Euphemia Leslie</span>, Countess
of <span class = "smallcaps">Ross</span> (1381), on both of which

268, and Plate XII., No.&nbsp;5): in No. 204 I give a woodcut of this
interesting composition; the Shields are, to the dexter, <span class =
"smallcaps">Leslie</span>&mdash;<i>Arg., on a bend az., three buckles

Imperial Eagle is sometimes represented crowned; the heads also in some
examples are encircled with a <i>nimbus</i> or glory, as in <a href =

English Peerage the Imperial Eagle still supports the Shields of some
few Peers of different ranks; as, for example, that of Baron <span class

<p>The German Heralds, and also their brethren of France, delight in
exaggerations of what I may distinguish as the Westminster Eagle,
<a href = "#fig200">No. 200</a>. The Austrian Eagle, besides having both
its heads crowned, has a large Imperial Crown placed between and above
the two heads, as in No. 211. The Imperial Eagle (Holy Roman Empire)
sometimes has a nimbus or glory about each head, which dignified
accessory is represented by a circular line, as in No. 212. In some
examples of Eagles, as well in our own Heraldry as in that of
continental countries, the wings are represented as <i>erect</i> (the
more usual form in England), and having the tips of all the principal
feathers pointing upwards, as in No. 213. The Eagle borne as the Ensign
of Imperial <span class = "smallcaps">France</span> was represented
grasping a thunderbolt, in an attitude of vigilance, having its wings

ensigns of high honour, and their use was restricted to a few persons of
eminence: they were attached by a <i>wreath</i>, or <i>torse</i>, or by
a <i>coronet</i>, to the helm or basinet; and sometimes a crest stood
upon a cap of estate. Crests are still represented standing upon either
a wreath, or a cap, or issuing from a coronet: but in our own Heraldry a
<i>crest-coronet</i> must always be carefully distinguished from those
coronets that are insignia of princely and noble rank. Crests are not
borne by ladies, a&nbsp;reigning Sovereign only excepted. (See

</div>

<p><i>Crown.</i> The ensign of Royal and Imperial dignity; in Heraldry
borne as a charge, and also used to denote the rank of a Sovereign
Prince. The Crown that is generally borne as a charge is represented
without arches, and resembling No. 232. Certain other crowns, each
distinguished by an appropriate title, are also sometimes borne on
shields, or introduced as heraldic accessories. (See <i>Celestial</i>,
<i>Eastern</i> or <i>Radiated</i>, <i>Mural</i>, <i>Naval</i>, and
<i>Vallary</i> Crowns.) The different forms assumed at different periods
by the Royal Crown of England are faithfully exemplified in the seals
and the coinage of the successive Sovereigns, and several fine examples
are preserved in the Royal effigies. The adornment of the regal circlet
was arbitrary before the fifteenth century; still, it always was
enriched with gems and surmounted by golden foliage. <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;V.</span> first arched his crown; and by <span
class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VI.</span> the circlet was first
heightened with alternate crosses-patée and fleurs de lys. This
arrangement has since been retained, the subsequent alterations being
restricted to changes in the number and in the contour of the arches.
The crown of His Majesty the <span class = "smallcaps">King</span> has
the circlet heightened with four crosses and as many fleurs de lys; from
the crosses rise the arches, which are surmounted by a mound and a
cross-patée. No. 234. This, the heraldic crown, is not an exact
reproduction of the actual crown of the King.</p>

<p><i>Crozier.</i> Strictly, the cross-staff of an archbishop;
distinguished by its form from the pastoral-staff with a crook-head, of
bishops; but the term is loosely and very

<p><i>Duke.</i> The highest rank and title in the British Peerage; first
introduced by <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> in the
year 1337, when he created the <span class = "smallcaps">Black
Prince</span> the first English Duke (in Latin, “<i>Dux</i>”).
A&nbsp;Duke is “Most Noble”; he is styled “My Lord Duke,” and “Your
Grace”; and all
<span class = "pagenum">117</span>
<a name = "page117" id = "page117"> </a>
his younger sons are “Lords,” and all his daughters “Ladies,” with the
prefix “Right Honourable.” His eldest son bears, by courtesy, his
father’s “second title”; and, accordingly, he generally bears the title
of Marquess. Whatever his title, however, the rank of the eldest son of
a Duke is always the same, and it assigns to him precedence between
Marquesses and Earls. The Coronet of a Duke, arbitrary in its adornment
until the sixteenth century was far advanced, is now a circlet,
heightened with eight conventional strawberry-leaves, of which in
representations three and two half-leaves are shown; No. 237. It
encloses a velvet cap. The present ducal coronet is represented in the
portrait of <span class = "smallcaps">Ludovick Stuart</span>, K.G., Duke
of <span class = "smallcaps">Richmond</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Lennox</span>, who died in 1624; the picture, the property
of the Crown, is at Hampton Court.</p>

<p><i>Ducal Coronet.</i> A term commonly, but not very accurately,
applied to a <i>Crest Coronet</i>. <a href = "#fig232">No. 232</a>.</p>

<p><i>Duchess.</i> The wife of a Duke. She is “Most Noble,” and is
styled “Your Grace.” Her coronet is the same as that of a Duke.</p>

<p><i>Eagle.</i> See <a href = "#chapIX">Chapter IX.</a>, <a href =

<p><i>Eaglet.</i> An Eagle on a small scale.</p>

<p><i>Earl.</i> In Latin, “Comes”; in French, “Comte” or “Count.” Before
1337, the highest, and now the third degree of rank and dignity in the
British
<span class = "pagenum">118</span>
<a name = "page118" id = "page118"> </a>
Peerage. An Earl is “Right Honourable”; he is styled “My Lord”; his
eldest son bears his father’s “second title,” generally that of
Viscount; his other sons are styled “Honourable,” but all his daughters
are “Ladies.” The circlet of an Earl’s Coronet has eight lofty rays of
gold rising from the circlet, each of which supports a large pearl,
while between each pair of these rays there is a golden strawberry-leaf.
In representations five of the rays and pearls are shown; No. 238.
Elevated clusters of pearls appear in an Earl’s coronet&mdash;that of
<span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Fitz Alan</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Arundel</span>&mdash;as early as 1445; but the present form
of the coronet may be assigned to the second half of the following
century.</p>

it was regularly charged upon a true Shield of Arms. Originally the

the fleurs de lys scattered freely over the field, and the Shield itself
having the appearance of having been cut out of a larger object, over
the whole surface of which the flowers had been <i>semée</i>. This
Shield of France is distinguished as “<i>France Ancient</i>”: No. 247.
About <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1365, <span class =

<p><i>Label</i>, or <i>File</i>. A narrow ribbon placed across the field
of a shield near the chief, and having three, five, or sometimes other
numbers of <i>points</i> depending from it, its object being to <i>mark
Cadency</i>. In the early Labels the number of the points was arbitrary,
the usual numbers being five and three; and, subsequently, three points
were almost universally used; the object always was to render the Label
conspicuous. In blazon a Label is supposed to have three points; but, if
more, the number is to be specified; thus, No. 271 is simply “<i>a
Label</i>,” but No. 272 is “<i>a Label of five points</i>.” Labels
appear early in the thirteenth century, and in the next century they are
in constant use. Various charges may be placed on the “points” of Labels
to extend their capacity for “differencing.” Since the time of <span
class = "smallcaps">Edward</span> the <span class = "smallcaps">Black
Prince</span> the Label of the <span class = "smallcaps">Prince of
Wales</span> has been plain silver. The Label is almost exclusively (now
without any exception) used in Royal Cadency; but, in modern Heraldry,
in the case of all other persons it is the peculiar mark of the eldest
son. The Label is also found as a charge. It has become a usage in the
degenerate days of Heraldry to represent the Label as in No. 273,
instead of the earlier and far preferable forms of Nos. 271, 272.</p>

of a Marquess.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Marquess</i>, <i>Marquis</i>. The second order of the British
Peerage, in rank next to that of Duke. This rank and title were
introduced into England in 1387, by <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span>, who then created his favourite,
<span class = "smallcaps">Robert De Vere</span>, Marquess of <span class
= "smallcaps">Dublin</span>. The next creation was by <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VI.</span>
<span class = "pagenum">137</span>
<a name = "page137" id = "page137"> </a>
A Marquess is “Most Honourable”; he is styled “My Lord Marquess”: all
his younger sons are “Lords,” and his daughters “Ladies”; his eldest son
bears his father’s “second title.” The Coronet, apparently contemporary
in its present form with that of Dukes, has its golden circlet
heightened with four strawberry leaves and as many pearls, arranged
alternately: in representations two of the pearls, and one leaf and two
half-leaves are shown, No. 277. The wife of a Marquess is a
“Marchioness”; her style corresponds with that of her husband, and her
coronet is the same.</p>

<p><i>Marshalling.</i> The disposition of more than one distinct coat of
arms upon a shield, so forming a single composition; or the aggroupment
of two or more distinct shields, so as to form a single composition;
also the association of such accessories as the helm, mantling, crest,
&amp;c., and of knightly and other insignia with a shield of arms, thus
again forming a single heraldic composition. See <a href =
"#chapXI">Chapter&nbsp;XI.</a></p>

<p><i>Martel.</i> A hammer.</p>

<p><i>Martlet.</i> The heraldic Martin, usually represented without
feet: Nos. <a href = "#fig160">160</a>, <a href = "#fig161">161</a>, and
<a href = "#fig70">70</a> and&nbsp;<a href = "#fig86">86</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mascle.</i> Lozenge voided: <a href = "#fig143">No. 143</a>.
<i>Masculée.</i> A&nbsp;field divided mascle-wise.</p>

<p><i>Masoned.</i> Representing brickwork.</p>

<p><i>Membered.</i> To denote the legs of a bird.</p>

<p><i>Merchant’s mark.</i> A device, adopted as early as 1400 by
merchants, as a substitute for heraldic ensigns which were not conceded
to them. Such marks are the predecessors of the <i>Trade-brands</i> and
<i>Marks</i> of after times.</p>

<p><i>Mermaid</i>, <i>Merman</i>, or <i>Triton</i>. The well-known
fabulous creatures of the sea, borne occasionally as charges, but
<span class = "pagenum">138</span>
<a name = "page138" id = "page138"> </a>
more frequently as supporters, badges, or crests. A&nbsp;mermaid was the
device of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">William de Brivere</span>, who
died in 1226, and it is the badge of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Berkeleys</span>.</p>

<p><i>Metal.</i> The Tinctures <i>Or</i> and <i>Argent</i>: Nos. <a href
= "#fig50">50</a>,&nbsp;51.</p>

<p><i>Mill-rind.</i> See <i>Fer-de-Moline</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mitre.</i> The ensign of archiepiscopal and episcopal rank, placed
above the arms of prelates of the Church of England, sometimes borne as
a charge, and adopted by the <span class = "smallcaps">Berkeleys</span>
as their crest. The contour of the mitre has varied considerably at
different periods, the early examples being low and concave in their
sides, the later lofty and convex. See <a href = "#fig159">No.
159</a>.</p>

<p><i>Moline.</i> A cross terminating like a Fer-de-moline, <a href =
"#fig97">No. 97</a>. In modern cadency it is the difference of the
eighth son.</p>

<p><i>Moon.</i> <a href = "#fig166">No. 166</a>, page 80.</p>

<p><i>Motto.</i> A word, or very short sentence, placed generally below
a shield but sometimes above a crest, an idea perhaps derived from the
“war-cries” of early times. A&nbsp;motto may be emblematical, or it may
have some allusion to the person bearing it, or to his name and armorial
insignia; or it may be the epigrammatic expression of some sentiment in
special favour with the bearer of it. As a matter of course, allusive
mottoes, like allusive arms, afford curious examples of mediæval puns.
I&nbsp;give a few characteristic examples:&mdash;“<i>Vero nil
verius</i>” (<i>nothing truer than truth</i>, or, <i>no greater verity
than in Vere</i>)&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Vere</span>; “<i>Fare,
fac</i>” (<i>Speak&mdash;act</i>; that is, <i>a word and
blow</i>)&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Fairfax</span>; “<i>Cave</i>”
(<i>beware</i>)&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Cave</span>; “<i>Cavendo
tutus</i>” (<i>safe, by caution</i>, or <i>by Cavendish</i>)&mdash;<span
class = "smallcaps">Cavendish</span>; “<i>Set on</i>,” says <span class
= "smallcaps">Seton</span>; “<i>Fight on</i>,” quoth <span class =
"smallcaps">Fitton</span>; “<i>Festina lente</i>” (<i>On slow&mdash;push
forward, but be cautious</i>, that is), adds <span class =
"smallcaps">Onslow</span>. Again: <span class =
"smallcaps">Jefferay</span> says, “<i>Je feray ce que je diray</i>”
(<i>I shall be true to my word</i>); <span class =
"smallcaps">Scudamore</span>&mdash;<i>Scutum amoris divini</i> (<i>the
shield of Divine love</i>); says <span class =
"smallcaps">James</span>&mdash;“<i>J’aime jamais</i>” (<i>I love
ever</i>);
<span class = "pagenum">139</span>
<a name = "page139" id = "page139"> </a>
says <span class = "smallcaps">Estwick</span>&mdash;“<i>Est hic</i>”
(<i>he is here</i>); and <span class =
"smallcaps">Pole</span>&mdash;“<i>Pollet virtus</i>” (<i>valour
prevails</i>); and <span class = "smallcaps">Tev</span>&mdash;“<i>Tais
en temps</i>” (<i>be silent in time</i>). The crest of <span class =
"smallcaps">Charteris</span>, an arm with the hand grasping a sword, has
over it&mdash;“<i>This our charter is</i>.” In his arms the Marquess
<span class = "smallcaps">Cholmondeley</span> bears <i>two helmets</i>,
and his motto is&mdash;“<i>Cassis tutissima virtus</i>” (<i>valour is
the safest helm</i>); the crest of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Martins</span> of Dorsetshire was an ape, with the
significant motto&mdash;“<i>He who looks at Martin’s ape, Martin’s ape
shall look at him!</i>” The motto of <span class =
"smallcaps">Perceval</span> is&mdash;“<i>Perse valens</i>” (<i>strong in
himself</i>); but, “<i>Do no yll</i>,” quoth <span class =
"smallcaps">Doyle</span>. Some “lippes,” as Camden remarks, have a taste
for “this kind of lettuce.”</p>

<p><i>Mound.</i> A globe, encircled and arched over with rich bands, and
surmounted by a cross-patée, the whole an ensign of the royal estate.
A&nbsp;mound or orb forms part of the regalia, and the same form appears
upon the intersecting arches of the crown of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Sovereign</span>; and it also surmounts the single arch of
the coronet of the <span class = "smallcaps">Prince of Wales</span>:
Nos. <a href = "#fig234">234</a>, <a href = "#fig289">289</a>.</p>

<p><i>Mount.</i> A green hill.</p>

<p><i>Mullet.</i> A star, generally of five, but sometimes of six or
more points (if more than five the number to be specified), always
formed by right lines, as No. 278. A&nbsp;mullet is sometimes “pierced,”
as in No. 279, when the tincture of the field is generally apparent
through the circular aperture. In modern cadency an unpierced mullet is
the difference of the third son. See <i>Estoile</i>.</p>

of examples the tips of the feathers are erect; in others they wave, or
slightly bend over. A&nbsp;panache may be charged with some device or
figure, “for difference,” as by the <span class =

a&nbsp;<i>martlet</i>, and a <i>fleur de lys</i>. In Nos. 283, 285, from

panache and mantling. Waving plumes formed of distinct feathers first

the sixteenth century.</p>

some wood-cutters, assumed their dress, and commenced working with them
on an oak, when the pursuers passed by. Hamilton, saw in hand, observed
his esquire anxiously watching their enemies as they passed, and at once
recalled his attention to his woodman’s duties by the word,
“Through!”&mdash;thus, at the same time, appearing to consider the
cutting down the oak to be far more important than the presence of the
strangers. So they passed by, and Hamilton followed in safety. This

Marshalling the Arms of Widowers, Widows, and others; Official Arms;

<p class = "quotation">
“Marshalling is a conjoining of diverse Coats in one Shield.”
&mdash;<span class = "smallcaps">Guillim.</span></p>


<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Upon</span> this concise definition, Guillim,
in another part of his work, adds the following
comment:&mdash;“<i>Marshalling</i> is an orderly disposing of sundry
Coat Armours pertaining to distinct Families, and their contingent
ornaments, with their parts and appurtenances, in their proper places.”
Hence it is apparent that this term, “Marshalling,” implies&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p>1. First, the bringing together and the disposition of two or more
distinct “Coats in one Shield”:</p>

<p>2. Secondly, the aggroupment of two or more distinct Coats to form a
single heraldic composition, the Shields being still kept distinct from
one another: and,</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, the association of certain insignia with a Shield of
arms, so as to produce a complete heraldic achievement.</p>
</div>

<p>The association of “Arms” with Names, Dignities, and Estates would
necessarily require, at an early period in the history of Heraldry, the
establishment of some regular and recognised system for the combination
and aggroupment of various distinct coats and insignia, whenever a
single individual became the representative of more than one family, or
was the hereditary possessor of several dignities and properties.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">159</span>
<a name = "page159" id = "page159"> </a>
<p>Again: it would be equally necessary that this system should extend
to <ins class = "correction" title = "text unchanged: error for ‘becoming the’?">the becoming</ins> heraldic declaration and record of
<i>Alliances</i> of every kind, including (a&nbsp;matter of no little
importance in the Middle Ages) <i>feudal dependence</i>.</p>

<p>In another, and a secondary sense, this same term,
<i>Marshalling</i>, is used by Heralds to denote the general arrangement
and disposition of heraldic charges and insignia in blazon upon the
field of a Shield.</p>

<p>In its simplest form, <span class = "smallcaps">Marshalling</span> is
effected by <i>Aggroupment</i> without Combination&mdash;by placing two
or more Shields of arms, that is, in such positions as to form a
connected group of distinct Shields, either with or without various
accessories. Seals afford excellent examples of Marshalling of this
order. These Seals may be classified in two groups,&mdash;one, in which
an effigy appears; and a second, in which the composition does not
include any effigy. Here I may observe that the same armorial blazonry
that was displayed upon their military surcoats by Princes, Nobles, and
Knights, was adopted by Ecclesiastics for the decoration of their
official vestments, and also (towards the close of the thirteenth
century) by Ladies of rank, as an appropriate style of ornamentation for
their own costume: and many examples of the effigies of Ladies, with a
few of Ecclesiatics, adorned in this manner with heraldic insignia,
exist in Seals and in Monumental Memorials. In Beverley Minster there is
a noble effigy of a priest, a&nbsp;member of the great family of <span
class = "smallcaps">Percy</span> (about <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1330), the embroideries of whose vestments are
elaborately enriched with numerous allied shields of arms. Upon his
episcopal seal, <span class = "smallcaps">Lewis Beaumont</span>, Bishop
of Durham from 1317 to 1333, has his effigy standing between two Shields
of Arms (to the dexter, <i>England</i>; to the sinister, a&nbsp;cross
potent between four groups of small crosses patées, three crosses in
each group), while his chasuble is semée de lys and also charged with a
lion rampant&mdash;the arms of the house of Beaumont.</p>

No. 318.&mdash; Seal of Joan, Countess of Surrey.</p>

<p>The aggroupment of various armorial ensigns upon a Seal, without the

In this remarkable composition, No. 318, the arms, blazoned on lozenges,
are, in the centre, <i>Warrenne</i>; in chief and base, <i>England</i>;
and to the dexter and sinister, <i>De Barre</i> (<a href = "#fig162">No.

the

Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Pembroke</span>, which is faithfully

<span class = "smallcaps">Beatrice</span>, sister of <span class =

of Brittany marshals, in the centre, the arms of her husband (<i>De
Valence</i>: <a href = "#fig86">No. 86</a>), and those of her father
(<i>De Chastillon</i>&mdash;<i>gu., three pallets vair, on a chief or a

“Dimidiation”&mdash;a process presently to be described: to the dexter,
the arms of her Royal relatives of <i>England</i> are blazoned in a
circular compartment: to the sinister, in a similar compartment, are the
fleurs de lys of <i>France Ancient</i>, <a href = "#fig247">No. 247</a>,
at that time so closely allied with the English lions: and, finally, in
a third roundle, in the base of the composition, are the arms of <i>De

this Seal, from which the woodcut, No. 319, was drawn, is appended to a
charter, dated 1347, which is preserved amongst the muniments of
Pembroke College. A&nbsp;very good example of the aggroupment of Shields
upon a Seal, under conditions differing from those that now have been
illustrated, I&nbsp;have already given in <a href = "#fig204">No.
204</a>. Another beautiful and most interesting example, now
unfortunately partially mutilated, is the Seal of <span class =

Prince <span class = "smallcaps">Lionel of Clarence</span>), and,
secondly, of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Ralph de Ufford</span>. This
seal, of circular form, No. 320, displays to the dexter a shield of
<i>De Burgh</i>&mdash;<i>or, a&nbsp;cross gu.</i>; to the sinister,
a&nbsp;shield of <i>Ufford</i>&mdash;<i>or, a&nbsp;cross engrailed

Countess was <span class = "smallcaps">Matilda de
Chaworth</span>)&mdash;<i>barrulée arg. and gu., an orle of martlets

<i>Lancaster</i>, to complete this remarkable heraldic group. Of the
legend there remains only .&nbsp;.&nbsp;ILLV MATILD’
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. SE&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The introduction of
<i>Badges</i>, with a Shield or Shields of arms, in the composition of a
Seal, is another variety of this same system of Marshalling. <a href =
"#fig321">No. 321</a>, the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Oliver de

of the noble house of <span class = "smallcaps">Bohun</span> thrice
repeated about the Shield. See <a href = "#fig114">No. 114</a>. Also

<p>Marshalling by Aggroupment was practised under another form by
placing Shields of arms in the different panels of the same
architectural monument.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Marshalling</span> <i>by Combination</i> is
effected by actually forming, for the blazonry of a single Shield,
a&nbsp;composition which includes the principal charges of two or more
allied Shields. The composition of the Shield borne by the house of
<span class = "smallcaps">De Dreux</span>, to which I have just referred
in describing the Seal of the Countess of Pembroke, No. 319, is a most
striking example of this variety of Marshalling: and this Shield was
borne by <span class = "smallcaps">John de Dreux</span>, created Earl of
<span class = "smallcaps">Richmond</span> by his uncle King <span class
= "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>, who lived and died in England, as
it is represented in No. 322&mdash;the <i>field, chequée or and
azure</i>, being for De Dreux; the <i>canton ermine</i> for Brittany;
and the <i>bordure, gules charged with golden lions of England</i>,
representing the royal Shield of England, and showing the close
connection existing between the Earl of Richmond and his Sovereign. The
shield of Prince <span class = "smallcaps">John</span> of <span class =
"smallcaps">Eltham</span> (<a href = "#fig24">No. 24</a>), <i>England
within a bordure of France</i>, is another characteristic example of
this Marshalling by Combination.</p>

<p>For many reasons, except in particular instances, these
<span class = "pagenum">166</span>
<a name = "page166" id = "page166"> </a>
methods of Marshalling were not considered to be altogether
satisfactory. Accordingly, a&nbsp;fresh arrangement was devised which
would preserve intact the original integrity of each coat of arms, would
imply a definite systematic method of arrangement, and would admit into
a single composition any required number of distinct coats. This <span
class = "smallcaps">Marshalling</span> <i>by Quartering</i>, naturally
suggested by such simple bearings as Nos. <a href = "#fig16">16</a> and
<a href = "#fig17">17</a>, consists in dividing the Shield, as in
<a href = "#fig30">No. 30</a>, into four parts, and placing in each of
these divisions or quarters one of the coats to be marshalled on a
single Shield. If two coats only are thus to be “<i>quartered</i>,” the
most important of the two occupies the first quarter, and is repeated in
the fourth; and, the other coat is placed in the second quarter, and
repeated in the third. The earliest example known in England is the
quartered Shield of <i>Castile and Leon&mdash;quarterly: first and
fourth, gules, a&nbsp;castle triple-towered or; second and third,
argent, a&nbsp;lion rampant gu.</i>, No. 323. This shield is sculptured
upon the monument in Westminster Abbey to <span class =
"smallcaps">Alianore</span>, daughter of <span class =
"smallcaps">Ferdinand&nbsp;III.</span>, King of <span class =
"smallcaps">Castile</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Leon</span>,
and Queen of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>: the date
is 1290. This form of Marshalling began gradually to be adopted during
the first half of the fourteenth century, and in the second half of that
century it became generally adopted. Other examples of quartered shields
I have already given in Nos. <a href = "#fig252">252</a> and <a href =
"#fig253">253</a>.</p>

<p>Should there be <i>three</i> Coats to be quartered, they would
severally occupy the first, second, and third quarters of the Shield, in
due order, and the first quarter would be repeated in the fourth. In
quartering <i>four</i> coats, no repetition would be necessary. If more
than four coats would require to be quartered, the Shield would be
divided into whatever number
<span class = "pagenum">167</span>
<a name = "page167" id = "page167"> </a>
of sections might be necessary, as in <a href = "#fig36">No. 36</a>, and
the required arrangement would be made; should any repetition be
necessary, the first quarter is to be repeated in the fourth. This
process, whatever the number of the coats thus marshalled (and their
number sometimes is very great), is always entitled “<i>quartering</i>”;
and each of these divisions of a Shield, for the purpose of Marshalling,
is distinguished as a “Quarter.” Occasionally a <i>quartered coat</i>
would have to be marshalled with others. In the “grand quartering” which
then takes place, the quartered coat is treated precisely as any other
member of the group. See <a href = "#fig37">No. 37</a>. For example, the
Shield, No. 324 (R.&nbsp;2), of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry</span>,
first Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Northumberland</span>,
is&mdash;I. and IV. Grand Quarters,&mdash;<i>first and fourth, or,
a&nbsp;lion rampt. az.</i>, for Louvaine, or Percy modern: <i>second and
third, gu., three lucies haurient arg.</i> (<a href = "#fig164">No.
164</a>) for Lucy: II. and III. Grand Quarters,&mdash;<i>az., five
fusils conjoined in fesse or</i>, for Percy ancient.</p>

<p>When a Shield to be quartered has a very numerous array of
Quarterings, Grand Quartering is seldom adopted; but, in its stead, the
new quarterings are marshalled in their proper succession, with the
original quarterings of the Shield.</p>

<p>In this Marshalling the first quarter is occupied by the most
important quartering, which is determined (without any fixed rule) by
the original grant or licence: the other quarterings follow, in the
order in which they may have been “brought in” to the composition.</p>

<p>To denote and record <span class = "smallcaps">Alliance by
Marriage</span>, two distinct Coats were first marshalled upon a single
Shield by <i>Dimidiation</i>. This process is accomplished in the
following manner. The Shield to be charged with the two Coats in union
is divided <i>per pale</i>, as in <a href = "#fig28">No. 28</a>: on the
dexter half
<span class = "pagenum">168</span>
<a name = "page168" id = "page168"> </a>
the corresponding half, or generally somewhat more than that half, of
the arms of the husband is marshalled: then, in like manner, the
sinister half is charged with the corresponding portion of the arms of
the wife. In the Shield, <a href = "#fig250">No. 250</a>, from another
Seal of Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Margaret</span>, <i>England</i>
dimidiates <i>France ancient</i>, Nos. <a href = "#fig187">187</a> and
<a href = "#fig247">247</a>. This Dimidiation in most cases produces a
singular effect; as in No. 325, a&nbsp;Shield from the Seal of the Mayor
of Winchelsea, one of the famous Sussex Cinque Ports, which bears
<i>England</i> dimidiating <i>azure, three hulls of ships, in pale,
or</i>: here the dimidiated lions and ships appear to unite for the
purpose of forming the most extravagant of compound monsters. The Seal
of the Borough of Great Yarmouth substitutes <i>three herrings</i>, in
allusion to the staple fishery of the port, for the ships, and
dimidiates them with the national lions. In the central Shield of the
Seal, <a href = "#fig319">No. 319</a>, I&nbsp;have shown <i>De
Valence</i> dimidiating <i>De Chastillon</i>. In No. 326, from the

one of the two barbels of Claremont.</p>

<p>The characteristic features of one or of both of the united Coats, as
I have just shown, being commonly rendered indistinct and uncertain by
Dimidiation, that form of marshalling was generally superseded by <span
class = "smallcaps">Impalement</span> in the course of the third quarter
of the fourteenth century. This process, at once simple and effectual,
marshals the whole of the husband’s arms on the dexter half of a Shield
divided per pale, as <a href = "#fig28">No. 28</a>; and the whole of the
arms of the wife on the sinister half of it. Such an impaled Shield is
borne by a husband and wife during their conjoint lives; and should the
wife become a widow, by her the impaled arms are borne during her
widowhood charged upon a lozenge. The dexter half only&mdash;the
husband’s arms&mdash;of an impaled Shield is hereditary. Fine examples
of Shields that are both impaled and quartered, are preserved in the
monuments of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> and his
Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Philippa</span>, in the Brass to <span
class = "smallcaps">Alianore de Bohun</span>, and in the monument to
<span class = "smallcaps">Margaret Beaufort</span>, all in Westminster

<p>It is to be observed that <i>Bordures</i> and <i>Tressures</i>, which
are not affected by Quartering, are <i>dimidiated by
Impalement</i>,&mdash;that is, that side of both a Bordure and a
Tressure which adjoins the line of Impalement is generally removed:
thus, one of the small Shields sculptured upon the canopy of the
monument of Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Mary Stuart</span>, at
Westminster, is charged with <i>D’Aubigny</i> impaling
<i>Scotland</i>,&mdash;that is, <i>az., three fleurs de lys or, within a
bordure gu. charged with eight buckles gold</i>, impaling <a href =
"#fig138">No. 138</a>. This Shield, represented in No. 328, has both the
bordure on its dexter half, and the tressure on its sinister half,
dimidiated by the impalement. There are other excellent examples of this
partial dimidiating in the monuments of <span class =

<p>A few very simple diagrams will clearly elucidate the principle of
Marshalling the arms of Husband and Wife. Suppose <span class =
"smallroman">B</span> (<i>Baron</i>) to represent the Husband, and <span
class = "smallroman">F</span> (<i>Femme</i>) the Wife: then, No. 330
<span class = "smallroman">B</span> may represent the arms
<span class = "pagenum">172</span>
<a name = "page172" id = "page172"> </a>
of the Husband, and No. 330 <span class = "smallroman">F</span> the arms
of the Wife. If <span class = "smallroman">F</span> be <i>not</i> an
heiress, the arms of <span class = "smallroman">B</span> and <span class
= "smallroman">F</span>, as husband and wife, are borne impaled, as in
No. 330 <span class = "smallroman">B F</span>; and their son bears No.
330 <span class = "smallroman">B</span> only. If <span class =
"smallroman">F</span> <i>be an heiress</i>, the arms of <span class =
"smallroman">B</span> and <span class = "smallroman">F</span>, as
husband and wife, are borne as in No. 331&mdash;the arms of the wife on
an Escutcheon of Pretence; and, in this case, the son of <span class =
"smallroman">B</span> and <span class = "smallroman">F</span> quarters
the arms of both his parents, as No. 332. Now, suppose this son, whose
arms are No. 332, to marry a lady, <i>not</i> an heiress, whose arms are
No. 330 <span class = "smallroman">F F</span>, he would simply impale
the arms of his wife, as in No. 333, and his son would bear No. 332
only, as his father bore that quartered shield before his marriage. But
if the wife of the bearer of No. 332 were to <i>be an heiress</i>, he
would charge the arms of his wife in pretence upon his own hereditary
paternal Shield, as in No. 334; and his son, by this heiress, as before,
would quarter the arms of both his parents, as in No. 335. It is obvious
that Marshalling on this system (of which I here give the general
outline) admits of a widely-extended application. Younger sons in all
<span class = "pagenum">173</span>
<a name = "page173" id = "page173"> </a>
cases place over all the quarterings of their Shield their own
distinctive Mark of Cadency, until they inherit some different
quartering from those to which the head of their house is entitled, and
the quartering itself then forms sufficient difference.</p>

<p>A <i>Widower</i> who marries again places the arms of both his wives
upon any permanent record, but for ordinary purposes of use, <i>e.g.</i>
on a seal or carriage, bears only the arms of his living wife.</p>

<p>An <i>Unmarried Lady</i> bears her paternal arms on a <i>lozenge</i>,
without any Helmet, Crest, or Motto.</p>

<p>A <i>Widow</i> bears on a <i>lozenge</i> the arms borne by her
husband and herself. Should she marry again, a&nbsp;Widow ceases to bear
the arms of her former husband.</p>

<p>A <i>Peeress in her own right</i>, if married to a Peer, has both her
own arms and those of her husband fully blazoned, and the lozenge and
the Shield, with all their accessories, are marshalled to form a single
united group, the achievement of the husband having precedence to the
dexter. If married to a Commoner, a&nbsp;Peeress in her own right bears
her own arms on a lozenge as before, and her husband marshals her arms
ensigned with her coronet in pretence on his Shield: and this lozenge
and Shield are grouped together, the lozenge yielding precedence.</p>

<p><i>Prelates</i> bear the arms of their see impaling their own
paternal and hereditary arms, the insignia of the see occupying the
dexter half of the Shield, this Shield being ensigned with a mitre only.
A&nbsp;married Prelate bears also a second Shield, placed to the
sinister of the other, on which are marshalled, in accordance with
ordinary usage, his own personal arms with those of his wife. The mitre
then is placed over the conjoined shields.</p>

<p>The <i>Kings of Arms</i>, in like manner, bear two Shields, disposed
to form a single group: on the dexter Shield their official arms impale
their personal; and on the sinister
<span class = "pagenum">174</span>
<a name = "page174" id = "page174"> </a>
Shield their personal arms are marshalled with the arms of their
wives.</p>

<p>Again, the same usage obtains in marshalling the arms of <i>Knights
of Orders of Knighthood</i> who, when married, bear two Shields grouped
together. On the dexter Shield are blazoned the arms of the Knight
himself alone; and around this Shield are displayed the insignia of his
Order, or Orders, of Knighthood: and on the sinister Shield the arms of
the Knight and of his wife are marshalled, but without the knightly
insignia. This second Shield is generally environed with decorative
foliage. This usage, prevalent in England, is not accepted or adopted by
foreign Heralds: nor does it appear to be required by true heraldic
principle, or to be strictly in accordance with it. The wife of a Knight
shares his knightly title, and takes precedence from her husband’s
knightly rank; and a knight, with perfect heraldic consistency, might
marshal his own knightly insignia about the Shield which is charged with
his own arms and those of his wife, whether united by impalement, or
when the latter are borne in pretence: and thus a single Shield would be
borne, and there would cease to exist any motive for endeavouring to
impart to a second Shield some general resemblance to its companion by
wreaths or other unmeaning accessories. There are ancient precedents for
the use of a single shield.</p>

<p><i>Official Arms</i> are not hereditary.</p>

<p><i>Royal Personages</i>, when married, bear their own arms on a
separate Shield; and a second Shield bears the arms of the husband and
wife conjoined.</p>

<p>The circumstances of every case must exercise a considerable
influence in determining the Marshalling of the Accessories of any
Shield, Lozenge, or Group. As a general rule, however, the <i>Helm</i>
always rests on the chief of the Shield: Commoners, Knights, Baronets,
and Peers place their <i>Crest</i> upon the Helm: Peers and Princes
place
<span class = "pagenum">175</span>
<a name = "page175" id = "page175"> </a>
their <i>Helm</i> upon the Coronet, and their Crest is placed upon the
Helmet. The <span class = "smallcaps">Sovereign</span> places the Crest
upon the Royal Crown, which is a part of the Royal Crest, and it is
unusual to duplicate the Crown by repeating it below the Helmet. The
<i>Mantling</i> is displayed from the back of the Helm: it is most
effective when simple in its form and adjustment, and when it droops
behind the Shield. The <i>Motto</i> is usually placed below the Shield;
but if it has special reference to the Crest, above the Crest.
A&nbsp;Scottish motto always goes over the Crest. <i>Supporters</i> are
usually placed erect, as if in the act of really supporting the Shield:
they ought to stand either on an appropriate ground, or on a Gothic
basement to the entire Achievement. <i>Badges</i>, with all
<i>Official</i> and <i>Knightly Insignia</i>, and all other
<i>Honourable Insignia</i> of every kind, are rightly marshalled in an
Achievement of Arms.</p>

<span class = "firstword">Amongst</span> his comrades in arms, or in the
midst of a hostile array, the last object that a mediæval Knight would
expect or desire to observe, on the morning of a battle or a joust,
would be an exact counterpart of himself. Occasions, indeed, might
sometimes arise, when it might be highly desirable that five or six
counterfeit “Richmonds” should accompany one real one to “the field”;
or, when a “wild boar of Ardennes” might prefer to encounter the
hunters, having about him the choice of his own “boar’s brood,”
garnished at all points exactly after his own fashion. These, however,
are rare and strictly exceptional cases. And the Knight, to whom
distinction was as the breath of his nostrils, as he closed his vizor
trusted confidently to his heraldic insignia to distinguish him, while,
in the fore-front of the fray, with sword and lance and axe he would
strive manfully to distinguish himself. This implies that Heraldry,
besides assigning to different families their own distinct insignia,
should possess the faculty of distinguishing the several members, and
also the various branches of the same family, the one from the other.
A&nbsp;faculty such as this Heraldry does possess, in its marks of <span
class = "smallcaps">Cadency</span>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">177</span>
<a name = "page177" id = "page177"> </a>
<p>In “<i>marking Cadency</i>”&mdash;that is, in distinguishing the
armorial insignia of kinsmen, who are members of the very same family,
or of some one of its various branches, it is a necessary condition of
every system of “Differencing” that, while in itself clear and definite
and significant, it should be secondary to the leading characteristics
of the original Coat of Arms which denotes the senior branch of the
Family, and also declares from what fountain-head all the kinsmen of all
the branches have derived their common descent.</p>

<p>Various methods for thus marking Cadency were adopted, and accepted
as satisfactory, in the early days of Heraldry. Of these I now shall
describe and illustrate such as are most emphatic in themselves, and in
their character most decidedly heraldic,&mdash;such also as most
advantageously may be retained in use in our own Heraldry of the present
time. It will be seen that the “Differences” which mark Cadency
necessarily resolve themselves into two groups or classes: one, in which
the “Difference” is <i>temporary</i> only in its significance and
use,&mdash;as, when an eldest son, on the death of his father, succeeds
to the position in the family which his father had held, he removes his
Mark of Cadency as eldest son from his Shield, assumes the unmarked
Shield as his father had borne it before him, and transfers to his own
son the mark that previously had distinguished his Shield from that of
his father. In the other group, the Marks of Cadency are more
<i>permanent</i>, and consequently may become integral elements of the
heraldic composition in which they appear: thus, the mark of Cadency
which distinguishes any particular branch of a family, is borne alike by
all the members of that branch, and in that branch it is transmitted
from generation to generation.</p>

<p>More than one Mark of Cadency may be introduced into the same Coat of
Arms; and, for the purpose of some
<span class = "pagenum">178</span>
<a name = "page178" id = "page178"> </a>
form of secondary distinction, it is quite correct Heraldry to <i>mark
Marks of Cadency</i>&mdash;to charge one variety of mark, that is, upon
another.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Label</span>, Nos. <a href =
"#fig271">271</a>, <a href = "#fig272">272</a>, is blazoned as a Mark of
Cadency in the earliest Rolls of Arms, and it appears discharging this
duty in the earliest examples. The Label is generally borne with three
points, as in <a href = "#fig271">No. 271</a>; frequently with five, as
in <a href = "#fig272">No. 272</a>; and occasionally with four or with
more than five points. It is quite certain that no significance was
formerly attached to the number of the points, the object in all cases
being to make the Label distinctly visible, and to adjust the points to
the general composition of the Shield. Labels are of various tinctures.
<span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;II.</span>, and <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>, each one during the lifetime of his
father, bore the Shield of England, <a href = "#fig187">No. 187</a>,
differenced with an <i>azure label</i>, sometimes of three points, as in
No. 336, and sometimes having five points. <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward</span> the <span class = "smallcaps">Black
Prince</span> marked the Royal Shield of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> with a <i>label argent</i>, as in
No. 337; and a plain silver label has since been the Mark of Cadency of
every succeeding heir-apparent to the English throne. The Label has been
used in this manner by personages of all ranks who have borne arms, from
the time of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>; and
examples abound in all the early Rolls of Arms, in Monuments, and upon
Seals.</p>

<p>The <i>Label</i>, borne as a Mark of Cadency, was sometimes,
<span class = "pagenum">179</span>
<a name = "page179" id = "page179"> </a>
particularly in the cases of junior members of the Royal Family, charged
with other figures and devices, as differences of a secondary rank. Or,
when it is thus charged, the charges upon a Label may be considered to
be elements of the Label itself, in its capacity of a Mark of Cadency.
<span class = "smallcaps">Edmond</span>, the first Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, as I have already shown, <a href =
"#fig249">No. 249</a>, differenced his father’s Arms of England with a
<i>Label of France</i>, No. 338&mdash;an azure label, that is, charged
with golden fleurs de lys, to denote his French alliance; and thus by
the same process he was Marshalling and Marking Cadency. <span class =
"smallcaps">John of Ghent</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, differenced with an <i>ermine Label</i>,
No. 339, derived from the ermine shield of Brittany (<a href =
"#fig15">No. 15</a>): and the Plantagenet Dukes of <span class =
"smallcaps">York</span> charged each point of their silver Label with
<i>three torteaux</i>, No. 340, which may be considered to have been
derived from the shield of Wake (<a href = "#fig82">No. 82</a>). In
order to show them on a larger scale, the Labels in Nos. 338-343 are
represented without the Shields on which they were charged. All these
Shields would be repetitions of the same blazonry of France and England
quarterly: Nos. <a href = "#fig252">252</a> and <a href =
"#fig253">253</a>.</p>

<p>Like the points of Labels, the Charges blazoned on those points had
no fixed or determinate numbers. That both the Labels and their Charges
should be distinct and conspicuous, was the special object with which
they were blazoned. Accordingly, in different examples of the same
<span class = "pagenum">180</span>
<a name = "page180" id = "page180"> </a>
Label the number of the repetitions of the Charges sometimes is found to
differ. At the same time, in the earliest examples of charged Labels,
the repetitions of the Charges, while devoid of any special differencing
aim or meaning, may be considered to have been suggested by the sources
from which the Charges themselves were derived. For example: the Label
of Lancaster, No. 338, of Earl <span class = "smallcaps">Edmond</span>,
derived directly from the Shield of <i>France ancient</i>, <a href =
"#fig247">No. 247</a>, with its field <i>semée de lys</i>, has three
fleurs de lys upon each point, so that this Label has the appearance of
being also <i>semée de lys</i>. Had it been derived from the Shield of
<i>France modern</i>, <a href = "#fig248">No. 248</a>, charged with
three fleurs de lys only, a&nbsp;single fleur de lys in all probability
would have been blazoned on each of the three points of this same Label.
Upon this principle the Label of Prince <span class =
"smallcaps">Lionel</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Duke</span> of
<span class = "smallcaps">Clarence</span>, second son of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>, which is differenced with
<i>cantons gules</i>, has a single canton on each point, as in No. 341,
evidently because only a single canton can be blazoned on a Shield. The
figures and devices that are charged for secondary difference upon
Labels vary widely in their character; but, however difficult it now may
be in very many instances to trace these differencing charges to their
sources, and so to determine the motive which led to their adoption,
there can be no doubt that originally they were chosen and adopted for
the express purpose of denoting and recording some alliance or
dependency. Some early Labels are of a compound character; that is, they
are charged with two distinct groups of devices, which are at once
divided and conjoined by impalement. Such a Label was borne by Prince
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry</span>, son of <span class =
"smallcaps">John</span> of <span class = "smallcaps">Ghent</span>,
between
<span class = "pagenum">181</span>
<a name = "page181" id = "page181"> </a>
the time of his father’s death and his own accession as <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span> (Feb. 3 to Sept. 30, 1399): it was a
<i>Label of five points per pale of Brittany and Lancaster</i>, No. 342,
being his father’s Label impaling that of his mother’s father. The
second son of this Prince, <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas</span> Duke
of <span class = "smallcaps">Clarence</span>, instead of adopting
impalement, charged <i>a red canton upon each point of an ermine
Label</i>, as in No. 343: while his brother, <span class =
"smallcaps">John</span> Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Bedford</span>, bore their father’s Label, No. 342.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Bordure</span>, both plain and charged,
is a Mark of Cadency borne by Princes and by personages of various
ranks. <span class = "smallcaps">Edmond</span>, youngest son of <span

with a plain <i>silver bordure</i>, as in No. 344: the <span class =
"smallcaps">Hollands</span>, Earls of <span class =
"smallcaps">Kent</span>, did the same: and the same silver bordure also
was borne by <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas</span>, youngest son of
<span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>, about the quartered
shield of <i>France ancient and England</i>; and about the quartered
shield of <i>France modern and England</i> by <span class =
"smallcaps">Humphrey</span>, youngest son of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span> Prince <span class =
"smallcaps">John</span> of <span class = "smallcaps">Eltham</span>, as I
have already shown, and after him the <span class =
"smallcaps">Hollands</span>, Dukes of <span class =
"smallcaps">Exeter</span>, differenced <i>England with a Bordure of
France</i>: <a href = "#fig24">No. 24</a>. Though not so numerous as
Labels, Bordures employed to mark Cadency exist in very many early
examples, and a variety of devices appear charged upon them for
secondary Difference. See <a href = "#fig140">No. 140</a>. In the Royal
Heraldry of our own times the Bordure is not used as a Royal Difference;
but its use is retained in Scotland for differencing Shields of less
exalted rank.</p>

<p>In some few early Examples a <span class = "smallcaps">Bendlet</span>
is charged upon the paternal shield as a mark of Cadency: and a <span
class = "smallcaps">Barrulet</span> is found to have been also used for
the same purpose. Thus, <span class = "smallcaps">Henry</span>, second
son of <span class = "smallcaps">Edmond</span> the first
<span class = "pagenum">182</span>
<a name = "page182" id = "page182"> </a>
Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, during the lifetime
of his elder brother, differenced <i>England</i> with an <i>azure
Bendlet</i>, as in No. 345: and, in the Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry de Percy</span>, son and heir of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry</span> third Baron, the lion is debruised, for
Difference, by a Barrulet which crosses the Shield in the honour-point.
Possibly, this Barrulet may be a <i>Label without points</i>.
A&nbsp;<span class = "smallcaps">Canton</span>, plain, or more
frequently charged, and in many examples of ermine, is also added to
Shields to mark Cadency, but more frequently nowadays its use denotes
absence of blood descent. See Nos. <a href = "#fig128">128</a>, <a href

</div>

<p>To mark Cadency by a <i>change of Tinctures</i> was a simple
expedient, and such a one as would naturally be practised at an early
period. It was effected, first, in the case of the <i>Field</i>: thus
(H.&nbsp;3) the brothers <span class = "smallcaps">De la Zouche</span>
severally bear&mdash;<i>Gu., bezantée</i>, and, <i>Az., bezantée</i>;
and the brothers <span class = "smallcaps">Furnival</span> (H.&nbsp;3)
bear&mdash;<i>Arg., a&nbsp;bend between six martlets gu.</i>, and,
<i>Or, a&nbsp;bend between six martlets gu.</i> Secondly, the change is
effected in the <i>Charges</i>: thus, two William <span class =
"smallcaps">Bardolfs</span> (H. 3 and E.&nbsp;2) severally
bear&mdash;<i>Az., three cinquefoils or</i>, and, <i>Az., three
cinquefoils arg.</i> Thirdly, the tinctures are <i>reversed</i>: for
example, for two Sir <span class = "smallcaps">John Harcourts</span>
(E.&nbsp;2)&mdash;<i>Gu., two bars or</i>, and, <i>Or, two bars gu.</i>
Fourthly, there is a complete change in <i>all the tinctures</i>: and
so, while Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Andrew Loterel</span>
(E.&nbsp;2) bears&mdash;<i>Or, a&nbsp;bend between six martlets sa.</i>,
Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Geffrey Loterel</span> (E.&nbsp;2)
bears&mdash;<i>Az., a&nbsp;bend between six martlets argent</i>.
Finally, this system of marking Cadency admits various modifications of
the changes already described: thus, in the Arms of Mortimer, <a href =
"#fig131">No. 131</a>, <i>gules</i> is substituted for <i>azure</i>;
and, again, in the same Shield an <i>inescutcheon ermine</i> takes the
place of the <i>inescutcheon argent</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
<p>Another and a favourite method of marking Cadency, calculated to
exercise a great and decided influence in the development of heraldic
blazon, is the <i>addition of secondary Charges</i> of small size (not
on a Label or a Bordure but) semée over the field of a Shield, or
charged upon an Ordinary, or disposed in orle. In a large number of
examples, these small charges are found to have been gradually reduced
to six or three, in order to admit of their being blazoned on a somewhat
larger scale, and consequently made more distinct. Again: while the
number and the tinctures of the secondary differencing charges remain
the same, in order to carry out the Cadency still farther the secondary
charges themselves are varied: and, once more, in other cases the
identity of the original secondary charges is retained, but their number
is increased or diminished. I&nbsp;must be content to illustrate these
various forms of Cadency with a few examples only. First, a&nbsp;group
of shields of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Beauchamps</span>:&mdash;Beauchamp of Elmely
(H.&nbsp;3)&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;fesse or</i>, No. 346: Beauchamp at
Carlaverock&mdash;<i>Gu., crusilée and a fesse or</i>, No. 347:
Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;fesse between six
crosses crosslets or</i>, No. 348: and Beauchamp of
Bletshoe&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;fesse between six martlets or</i>, No.
349. Second, a&nbsp;corresponding group of shields of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Berkeleys</span>:&mdash;Maurice de Barkele (or
Berkeley)&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;chevron arg.</i> (H.&nbsp;3): and then
for other Berkeleys&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;chevron between ten crosses
pattées, six and four, arg.</i>; and the same Ordinary, with either
<i>ten
<span class = "pagenum">184</span>
<a name = "page184" id = "page184"> </a>
cinquefoils of silver</i>, or the same number of <i>white roses</i>.
Three <span class = "smallcaps">Corbets</span> bear severally
(E.&nbsp;2)&mdash;<i>Or, a&nbsp;raven sa.</i>; <i>Or, two ravens
sa.</i>; and, <i>Or, three ravens sa.</i> And, once more, their original
Shield&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;chevron or</i>, is differenced by the <span
class = "smallcaps">Cobhams</span> by charging the Ordinary with three
lioncels, three eaglets, three crosslets, three mullets, three estoiles,
three crescents, or three fleurs de lys, all of them sable. The
particular devices and figures selected thus to mark Cadency, like those
charged upon Labels or Bordures, must be considered to have a special
significance of their own, though this significance may frequently fail
to be discerned in consequence of our being no longer able to trace out
their association with the sources from which they were obtained. The
alliances and the incidents that give these various Marks of Cadency,
when it is possible to ascertain what they may have been, illustrate in
a striking manner the motives by which the early Heralds were influenced
when they differenced the Arms of Kinsmen.</p>

and charges three golden mitres upon each point of the Label of

Despencer</span>, Bishop of Norwich (<span class =

<i>azure bordure charged with eight golden mitres</i> (see the largest
shield in No. 351). On his official seal the canopied effigy of the
Bishop stands between this, his personal Shield, and the Shield of his

<p>At an early period, Cadency was marked by <i>adding a single small
charge</i> to the blazon of a Shield, or by charging some secondary
device or figure upon any accessory of a Shield of arms. Such a Mark of
Cadency as this, obtained from some allied Shield, and charged upon an
ordinary or principal bearing, or occupying a conspicuous position in
the general composition, was in high favour with the Heralds of both the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. From the early examples, which exist
in great numbers and in as great variety, it will be sufficient for me
to adduce only a few specimens&mdash;a single example, indeed,
illustrates the system. The Shield of <i>Ufford</i>, in the Seal of
<span class = "smallcaps">Matilda</span> of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, which I have already described (<a href =
"#fig320">No. 320</a>), is thus differenced with a single fleur de lys
in the first quarter. Precisely in the same manner Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Fulk Fitz Warin</span> differences the Shield of the head of
his house, <a href = "#fig17">No. 17</a>, by charging a <i>mullet
sable</i> upon the first quarter, as in No. 352.</p>

<p>Differences of Illegitimacy, which rightly and indeed necessarily are
included under the general head of “Cadency,” do not appear at any time
to have assumed a definite or decided character, and yet they bring
before the student of Heraldry much curious matter for inquiry and
investigation. Early in the true heraldic era illegitimate sons are
found to have differenced their paternal arms, as other sons lawfully
born might have done: and it does not appear that any peculiar methods
of differencing were adopted, palpably for the purpose of denoting
illegitimacy
<span class = "pagenum">188</span>
<a name = "page188" id = "page188"> </a>
of birth, before the fourteenth century had drawn near to its close. And
even then, if any express heraldic rule on this point ever was framed,
which is very doubtful, it certainly was never observed with any care or
regularity.</p>

No. 359.&mdash; Henry,<br>
Earl of Worcester.</p>
</div>

<p>The earliest known example of the arms of a man of illegitimate birth
is the fine Shield of <span class = "smallcaps">William
Longespée</span>, Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Salisbury</span>,
son of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;II.</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Fair Rosamond</span>, <a href = "#fig197">No. 197</a>. This
Shield is supposed to have been assumed and borne by the Earl on his
marriage with the daughter and heiress of <span class =
"smallcaps">D’Evreux</span>, when in right of his wife he succeeded to
the Earldom of Salisbury: but this theory does not rest upon any solid
foundation, since it would be very difficult to show that the Shield
with the six lioncels was certainly borne, on his armorial ensign, by
the father-in-law of Earl William. Also, if a Shield charged with an
escarbuncle and many lioncels, which has been assigned to <span class =
"smallcaps">Geoffrey</span> Count of <span class =
"smallcaps">Anjou</span>, was really borne by the Founder of the House
of <span class = "smallcaps">Plantagenet</span>, Earl <span class =
"smallcaps">William Longespée</span> may have derived his own Shield
from his paternal grandfather. Upon his Counterseal the Earl displays
his own “long sword” as his proper device. In like manner, certain other
personages, also illegitimate, appear to have borne arms which were
either expressly assigned to themselves by the Sovereign, or such as
they assumed in right of their mothers or wives. In all such cases as
these, the Arms were not the paternal coat in any way differenced, but
what now would be designated “fresh grants.” Towards the beginning of
the fifteenth century, however, a&nbsp;peculiar kind of Differencing for
Illegitimacy gradually prevailed throughout Europe: thus, illegitimate
children either altered the position of the charges in their paternal
Shield; or they marshalled the entire paternal arms upon a bend or a
fesse; or they composed for themselves a fresh Shield, either using
their father’s badges and the actual charges of his Shield, or
<span class = "pagenum">189</span>
<a name = "page189" id = "page189"> </a>
adopting devices evidently derived from the paternal bearings; or they
bore the paternal Shield differenced in a peculiarly conspicuous manner
with certain marks by which they might be readily and certainly
distinguished.</p>

<p>When the composition of the paternal Shield would admit of such an
arrangement, the field not being argent, an illegitimate son sometimes
bore his father’s arms marshalled fesse-wise, so as to leave both the
chief and the base of his Shield plain white. <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Worcester</span>, whose father was an illegitimate son of
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry Beaufort</span>, third Duke of <span

this manner in chief and in base, as if they were charged upon a very
broad fesse on the field: No. 359.</p>

<p>Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Roger de Clarendon</span>, illegitimate
son of the <span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, bore <i>on a
sable bend the three Ostrich Feathers</i> of his illustrious father’s
“<i>Shield of Peace</i>,” the field of his Shield being golden, as in
No. 363. Here the “Difference for Illegitimacy” is very emphatically
marked in a singularly felicitous and beautiful Shield.</p>

<p>The paternal arms of illegitimate children have also sometimes been
carried by them charged on a <i>canton</i>, either dexter or sinister,
the rest of the Shield being left blank, or perhaps in some cases
displaying the maternal arms; of this usage I am not able to give any
good example, in English Heraldry, of certain authority: one other
variety of these singular Shields, however, I&nbsp;must add to my small
group of examples, which was first noticed by Mr. <span class =
"smallcaps">Montagu</span> (“Guide to the Study of Heraldry,” p. 44).
This is the Shield, No. 364, of <span class = "smallcaps">Radolphus de
Arundel</span>; and it bears the quartered arms of the Earls of <span
class = "smallcaps">Arundel</span>&mdash;<i>Fitz Alan</i> and
<i>Warrenne</i> (<i>gu. a&nbsp;lion rampt. or</i>, and <a href =
"#fig68">No. 68</a>), “<i>flanched</i>,”&mdash;that is, blazoned only
upon the flanches (see <a href = "#fig141">No. 141</a>) of the Shield,
the central area being blank.</p>

<p>For a lengthy period the use of the <i>bend</i>, <i>bendlet</i>, and
<i>baton sinister</i> was usual for the purpose of denoting
illegitimacy, but this has now given way to the use, in England, of a
<i>bordure wavy</i>; in Scotland, of a <i>bordure compony</i>; whilst in
Ireland both these <i>bordures</i> are used, more usually, however, the
<i>bordure wavy</i> being employed. By a curious divergence the
<i>bordure wavy</i> is not a mark of illegitimacy in Scotland, but a
mark of perfectly legitimate cadency. The use of the <i>bendlet
sinister</i> for the debruising of crests still exists in
<span class = "pagenum">192</span>
<a name = "page192" id = "page192"> </a>
England and Ireland, but crests are not usually differenced for any
reason in Scotland.</p>

<p>In treating of this subject, some writers have maintained that the
<i>bordure componée</i> is, in its heraldic nature, the most decided and
unquestionable Difference for Illegitimacy: and this opinion these
writers have derived from the singularly contradictory fact, that the
<span class = "smallcaps">Beauforts</span> differenced with a bordure
componée when they became legally <i>legitimate</i>. A&nbsp;bordure <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘componeé’">componée</ins>
<i>may</i>, indeed, be used with such an intention, as it is used by the
Duke of <span class = "smallcaps">Richmond</span>, who bears the arms of
<span class = "smallcaps">Charles&nbsp;II.</span> within a <i>bordure
componée arg. and gu., charged with eight roses of the last</i>; but by
the <span class = "smallcaps">Beauforts</span> it was used with an
intention exactly the reverse of this. The bordure, however, whatever
its aspect or modification of treatment, remains still, as it was of
old, an honourable Difference, until some abatement of honour has been
associated with its presence under special circumstances. But the
stereotyped use of the <i>bordure wavy</i> in England with a set
meaning, gives to the wavy variety a lack of desirability. Marks of
illegitimacy are intended to remain upon a shield for all time, although
in a few historic cases their use has been discarded. And precisely the
same words may be applied to any other charge that has been employed, or
may be required to mark Cadency.</p>

<p>Marks of Cadency, as they are borne on Shields of Arms, may also be
charged on Badges, Crests, and Supporters. As a matter of course, they
appear on Armorial Banners and Standards under the same conditions that
they are blazoned upon Shields and Surcoats. Such examples as may be
necessary to illustrate heraldic usage in these cases, I&nbsp;propose to
describe in the following Chapters.</p>

<p>It cannot be necessary for me to adduce any arguments in order to
impress upon Students of Heraldry the importance of investigating early
Cadency, or to assure them that a special interest is inseparable from
this inquiry: I&nbsp;may
<span class = "pagenum">193</span>
<a name = "page193" id = "page193"> </a>
suggest, however, that it is most desirable that Students should arrange
groups of allied Shields, and should carefully blazon them with their
various “Marks of Cadency,” being careful also to record their
authorities for every example.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Modern Cadency</span> is marked by the

distinguishing similar Arms, when they are borne by individuals or
families between whom no kind of alliance is known to have existed. It
is evident, on the one hand, that a feudal influence would naturally
lead to some degree of assimilation to the Coat-Armour of the feudal
Chief, in the Arms of all allies and dependants: and, on the other hand,
it will readily be understood that, even in the early days of its
career, Heraldry would see the necessity for providing for the
constantly increasing demands upon its resources; and, consequently,
that it would organise a system which would enable the same Ordinaries
and the same principal Charges to appear in distinct Shields, without
either confusion or misapprehension.</p>

<p>It is highly probable, and indeed it may be assumed to be certain,
that what I have called a “feudal influence,” in the thirteenth and
fourteenth centuries in no slight degree affected the general
composition of Coats of Arms. In very many instances the working of this
influence is still palpable; and it is always interesting to the student
of Heraldry, as it must always be eminently useful to the student of
History, to detect its presence and to explore its method of action.
Like Cadency, feudal Differencing is expressed by various means, all of
them indicating, in a greater or a less degree, the motive which
suggested their adoption. I&nbsp;proceed at once to examples, which
illustrate and explain the system so clearly and so fully, that
prolonged introductory remarks are altogether superfluous.</p>

Clare in Suffolk, differenced the Shield of the Earls by charging
<i>silver fleurs de lys</i> on each chevronel, as in No. 367
(E.&nbsp;2); and, for secondary difference, they sometimes added a
<i>bordure azure</i>, as in the fine early Brass at Pebmarsh, near
Clare. Again: by a change of tinctures, without affecting the charges of
the Shield, the Arms of <span class = "smallcaps">L’Ercedeckne</span>

shield, No. 368&mdash;<i>Or, a&nbsp;bend between six martlets sa.</i>,
was also differenced by other families to mark their feudal alliance
with the house of Luterell. Thus, the <span class = "smallcaps">De
Furnivals</span>, themselves a powerful and distinguished family, who
held their lands by feudal tenure under the Luterells, in token of this
alliance bore the Shield of De Luterell with a fresh change of

as&mdash;<i>Arg., a&nbsp;bend between six martlets gu.</i> Then, while

<p>North of the Tweed, also, the same principle is found to be
exemplified in Scottish Heraldry. “In Annandale,” writes Mr. <span class
= "smallcaps">Seton</span>, “the chief and saltire of the Bruces are
carried (of different tinctures and with additional figures) by the
Jardines, Kirkpatricks, Johnstons, and other families.” The arms of
<span class = "smallcaps">Bruce</span> are&mdash;<i>Or, a&nbsp;saltire
and a chief gu.</i>, <a href = "#fig73">No. 73</a>: those of <span class
= "smallcaps">Jardine</span> are&mdash;<i>Arg., a&nbsp;saltire and a
chief gu., the latter charged with three mullets of the field, pierced
of the second</i>: and the arms of <span class =
"smallcaps">Kirkpatrick</span> are&mdash;<i>Arg., a&nbsp;saltire and
chief az., the latter charged with three cushions or</i>. This coat of
Kirkpatrick is also borne by the <span class =
"smallcaps">Johnstons</span>, the tinctures differenced
thus&mdash;<i>Arg., a&nbsp;saltire sa., and on a chief gu. three
cushions or</i>.</p>

<p>Once more, returning to the southern side of the Scottish border, of
<span class = "smallcaps">Richard de Neville</span>, the renowned
“King-maker,” we find it to be recorded that, so great was his
popularity at Calais, of which city he was governor, that his Badges
were universally adopted,&mdash;“no man esteeming himself gallant whose
head was not adorned with his <i>silver ragged staff</i> (<a href =
"#fig294">No. 294</a>); nor was any door frequented, that had not his
<i>white cross</i> (silver saltire, <a href = "#fig121">No. 121</a>)
painted thereon.” This was an extravagant application of the earlier
usage in
<span class = "pagenum">199</span>
<a name = "page199" id = "page199"> </a>
denoting feudal alliance, such as was in keeping with the heraldic
sentiment of the second half of the fourteenth century. Those good
citizens of Calais, however, who were Neville-worshippers four hundred
years ago, were not singular in exhibiting an armorial ensign at the
entrance to their houses. Numerous, indeed, are the doorways in various
parts of England, and particularly in the counties of Surrey, Sussex,
and Norfolk, which in the “sign of the chequers” still display the
insignia (<i>chequée or and az.</i>, <a href = "#fig68">No. 68</a>) of
the once mighty Earls of <span class = "smallcaps">Warrenne</span> and
<span class = "smallcaps">Surrey</span>; and thus show that relics of
the old feudal influence are endowed with a tenacious vitality, which
prolongs their existence for ages after the feudal system itself has
passed away. But no doubt some cases must be referred to the less
romantic explanation of the reckoning board of the Steward.</p>

<p>Differencing adopted, so far as now is apparent, <i>simply for the
sake of distinction</i>, lays open before the student of Heraldry a wide
and a diversified field of inquiry. All the miscellaneous charges that
are associated in blazon with the Ordinaries, and also with the
Subordinaries, thus are brought under consideration; and, without a
doubt, it was for the express purpose of Differencing that many of these
charges were introduced into English Heraldry. How far some remote
degree of relationship, or some subordinate feudal motive now lost to
sight and forgotten, may originally have affected the choice of Charges
“for difference,” it is not possible now to determine; nor can we always
follow the rebus-loving search for a “Difference,” that might speak
through that allusive quality which is a primary element of the Herald’s
science. We do know that the act of bearing the same arms by different
families, without some heraldic Difference, was of very rare occurrence;
and that, when it did occur, it was regarded with marked surprise, and
on more than one occasion led to a memorable controversy: and, further,
we find great numbers of early differenced
<span class = "pagenum">200</span>
<a name = "page200" id = "page200"> </a>
Shields, which illustrate in a very effective manner the growth and
development of English Heraldry. Shields of this order have strong
claims on our attention. The examples that I am able here to place
before students are to be regarded simply as specimens, few in number,
and yet sufficient to show some of the varied forms under which early
Differencing was effected.</p>

<p>The proceedings in the High Court of Chivalry in the suit between Sir
<span class = "smallcaps">Richard le Scrope</span> and Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Robert Grosvenor</span>, relative to the right to the
Arms&mdash;<i>Azure, a&nbsp;bend or</i>, <a href = "#fig111">No.
111</a>&mdash;commenced on the 17th of August 1385, and the final
judgment of the King himself upon the appeal of the defendant against
the finding of the Court was not pronounced till the 27th of May 1390.
On the 15th of May 1389 the judgment of the Court assigned the
arms&mdash;<i>Azure, a&nbsp;bend or</i>&mdash;to Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard le Scrope</span>; and to Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Robert Grosvenor</span>, these arms&mdash;<i>Az.,
a&nbsp;bend or, within a plain bordure argent</i>. Thus the Court
confirmed to Sir Richard le Scrope the right to bear the Ordinary in its
severe simplicity, without any other charge and without any Difference:
and, at the same time, it was decided that these arms of Scrope should
be differenced, in order that they might become the arms of Grosvenor,
and the “Difference” was to be a <i>plain silver bordure</i>. The whole
of the proceedings in this remarkable case are preserved, and have been
published; and they derive a peculiar interest from the circumstance,
that amongst the witnesses who gave evidence was the father of English
Poetry, <span class = "smallcaps">Geoffrey Chaucer</span>. Appeal having
been made to the Sovereign, <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span> determined that a “plain bordure
argent” was a Mark of Cadency, good and right, and perfectly sufficient
as a Difference “between Cousin and Cousin in blood”; but that it was
“not a sufficient Difference in Arms between two strangers in blood in
one kingdom.” The King, therefore, cancelled and annulled the
<span class = "pagenum">201</span>
<a name = "page201" id = "page201"> </a>
sentence of the Court of Chivalry; and in so doing he gave a very clear
definition of the distinction to be observed in Heraldry between kinsmen
and strangers in blood. Then it was that the Shield, <i>Azure,
a&nbsp;garb or</i>, was adopted as the arms of Grosvenor. We may assume,
that the judgment of the Court would have been confirmed by the King,
had Sir Robert Grosvenor been commanded to blazon his golden bend
between two garbs, or charged with one or more garbs, or with three
garbs on a chief, or with any other decided Difference which would be
palpably distinct from a Mark of Cadency.</p>

<p>The examples of Differenced Shields which follow I have selected from
the Roll of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;II.</span> It will be
seen that in each small group of these examples some primary feature of
the composition is common to every Shield, so that the distinction
between the Shields in each group is effected either by a simple change
of tinctures, or by the introduction of various secondary charges.</p>

an addition to a Shield of arms, specially granted by the Sovereign to
commemorate some worthy or illustrious deed, and forming an integral
element of the Shield as an hereditary bearing. Such additions will be
found marshalled in the forms of Chiefs and Inescutcheons as Cantons, or

other accessories of Shields.</p>

the Arms of <span class = "smallcaps">Howard</span>. These Arms before
the battle of Flodden were&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;bend between six crosses
crosslets fitchée arg.</i> To commemorate the great victory won by him
at Flodden Field, Sept.&nbsp;9, 1513, when <span class =
"smallcaps">James&nbsp;IV.</span> of Scotland was defeated and slain,
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span> granted to <span class
= "smallcaps">Thomas Howard</span>, Duke of Norfolk, and to his
descendants, as an Augmentation of Honour, the <i>Royal Shield of
Scotland</i> (<a href = "#fig138">No. 138</a>), <i>but having a
demi-lion only, which is pierced through the mouth with an arrow</i>, to
be borne in the middle of the bend of his proper arms. This Shield is
represented in No. 374; and in No. 374<span class =
"smallroman">A</span> the augmentation is shown on a larger scale.</p>

<p>A small group of additional examples will be sufficient to illustrate
this most interesting class of historical Arms, and at the same time
will not fail to excite in students a desire very considerably to extend
the series through their own inquiries and researches. In memory of the
devoted courage and all-important services of <span class =
"smallcaps">Jane Lane</span>, after the disastrous battle of Worcester,
<span class = "smallcaps">Charles&nbsp;II.</span> granted as an
Augmentation a <i>Canton of England</i> (<a href = "#fig187">No. 187</a>
marshalled on a canton), to be added to the hereditary Coat of Lane,
<span class = "pagenum">206</span>
<a name = "page206" id = "page206"> </a>
which is&mdash;<i>Per fesse or and az., a&nbsp;chevron gu. between three
mullets counterchanged</i>. The Crest of the family of <span class =
"smallcaps">De la Bere</span> is said to have been conferred by the
<span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span> upon <span class =
"smallcaps">Sir Richard de la Bere</span>, as a memorial of the good
service rendered by that gallant knight on the memorable field of
Cressi. This Crest is&mdash;<i>Out of a crest-coronet a plume of five
ostrich feathers per pale arg. and az.</i>, the Plantagenet
colours&mdash;the device (as Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Lower</span>
observes) being evidently derived from the Prince’s own Badge, and also
forming a variety of the “panache,” the Crest then held in such high
estimation. The heart charged upon the shield of <span class =
"smallcaps">Douglas</span> (see Nos. <a href = "#fig156">156</a>,
<a href = "#fig157">157</a>, p. 74) is another remarkable Augmentation. So
also is the adoption of the armorial insignia of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Confessor</span>, <a href = "#fig2">No. 2</a>, by <span
class = "smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span>, and his marshalling it upon
his own Royal Shield, impaled to the dexter with the quartered arms of
France and England.</p>

<p>English Heraldry has been required to recognise another and a
perfectly distinct class of “Augmentations,” which consist of additions
to the blazonry of a Shield or of additional quarterings or accessories,
granted as tokens of Royal favour, for heraldic display, but without any
particular “merit” in the receiver, or any special historical
significance in themselves. Augmentations of this order may be
considered to have been first introduced by <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span>, when he granted, “out of his mere
grace,” to his favourite <span class = "smallcaps">Robert de
Vere</span>, Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Oxford</span>, Marquess
of <span class = "smallcaps">Dublin</span> and Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Ireland</span>, a&nbsp;differenced Coat of <span class =
"smallcaps">St. Edmund</span> (No.&nbsp;<a href =
"#fig3">3</a>)&mdash;<i>Az., three crowns or, within a bordure
argent</i>, to be quartered with the <span class = "smallcaps">De
Vere</span> arms as the arms of <span class =
"smallcaps">Ireland</span>. In the same spirit, <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span> granted, as similar Augmentations,
the arms of the <span class = "smallcaps">Confessor</span> to be
marshalled, with Differences, on their Shields by <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">John
Holland</span>, Dukes of <span class = "smallcaps">Surrey</span> and
<span class = "smallcaps">Exeter</span>, and by <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas Mowbray</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Norfolk</span>. It will be remembered that it was one of the
capital charges against the
<span class = "pagenum">207</span>
<a name = "page207" id = "page207"> </a>
then Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Surrey</span>, a&nbsp;lineal
descendant of this <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas Mowbray</span>, the
Duke of <span class = "smallcaps">Norfolk</span>, in 1546, that he had
assumed, without the special licence of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span>, the same arms of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Confessor</span> as an augmentation.</p>

<p>By <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;IV.</span> similar
augmentations, “by grace” and not “for merit,” were granted; and by
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span> the system was carried
to excess in the grants made to augment the armorial blazonry of <span
class = "smallcaps">Anne Boleyn</span>, and of his English consorts, her
successors.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Abatement</span> is a term which was
unknown until it made its appearance in certain heraldic writings of the
sixteenth century, when it was used to denote such marks or devices as,
by the writers in question, were held to be the reverse of honourable
Augmentation&mdash;<i>Augmentations of dishonour</i> indeed, and tokens
of degradation. True Heraldry refuses to recognise all such pretended
abatements, for the simple reason that they never did exist, and if they
could exist at all, they would be in direct antagonism to its nature,
its principles, and its entire course of action. Honourable itself,
Heraldry can give expression only to what conveys honour, and it records
and commemorates only what is to be honoured and held in esteem.</p>

<p>The very idea of an heraldic Abatement implies, if not a complete
ignorance, certainly a thorough misconception of the character and the
office of Heraldry. Even if Heraldry were to attempt to stigmatise what
is, and what ought to be esteemed, dishonourable, who would voluntarily
accept insignia of disgrace, and charge and display them upon his
Shield, and transmit them to his descendants? And the believers in
Abatement must hold that Heraldry can exert a compulsory legislative
power, which might command a man to blazon his own disgrace, and force
him to exhibit and to retain, and also to bequeath, any such blazonry.
A&nbsp;belief in heraldic Abatement, however, is by no means singular or
rare. A&nbsp;curious example of its
<span class = "pagenum">208</span>
<a name = "page208" id = "page208"> </a>
existence was recently brought under my notice, in connection with one
of the most renowned of the historical devices of English Heraldry. The
<i>bear</i>, the badge of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Beauchamps</span>, Earls of <span class =
"smallcaps">Warwick</span>, which appears at the feet of the effigy of
Earl <span class = "smallcaps">Richard</span> in the Beauchamp chapel at
Warwick, in accordance with a special provision to that effect, is
“<i>muzzled</i>”; and, wearing a muzzle has this bear been borne, as
their Badge, by the successors of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Beauchamps</span> in the Warwick Earldom, the Earls of the
houses of <span class = "smallcaps">Neville</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Dudley</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Rich</span>, and
<span class = "smallcaps">Greville</span>. But, it would seem that a
legend has found credence at Warwick Castle itself, which would
associate the muzzle of the bear with some dishonourable action of an
Earl of the olden time; and, consequently, it was proposed that at
length this Abatement should be removed from the bears still at Warwick!
Earl <span class = "smallcaps">Richard de Beauchamp</span> was not
exactly the man to have displayed upon <i>his</i> bear any ensign of
dishonour; nor were his son-in-law, the “King-maker,” and Queen <span
class = "smallcaps">Elizabeth’s</span> <span class = "smallcaps">Robert
Dudley</span>, at all more probable subjects for any similar display;
still, it is quite certain that they bore the muzzled bear, as he
appears on the seal of the great Earl, <a href = "#fig448">No.
448</a>.<a class = "tag" name = "tag7" id = "tag7" href = "#note7">7</a>
That muzzle, doubtless, has its becoming heraldic significance, without
in the slightest degree partaking in the assumed character of an
Abatement. I&nbsp;hope eventually to be able to trace out conclusively
what the muzzle may really imply, and I commend the research to other
inquirers: meanwhile, neither at Warwick nor elsewhere is there any such
thing as “Abatement” in English Heraldry.</p>

<span class = "firstword">The</span> idea of a <span class =

its crowning adornment, appears inseparable from the existence and use
of a Helm. The Warriors and Warrior Divinities of classic antiquity are
represented to us, wearing head-pieces richly crested: and, in the
Middle Ages, had no other Heraldry ever been devised, assuredly
ornaments of some kind would have been placed on helms and basinets, and
these insignia would have been held in high esteem and honour.
Accordingly, about the time that Coat-Armour became hereditary, having
been reduced to a system and accepted as an independent science,
heraldic Crests began to be worn as honourable distinctions of the most
exalted dignity by the mediæval chivalry.</p>

<p>Upon the Second Great Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;I.</span> the cylindrical helm of the King
appears surmounted by a kind of
<span class = "pagenum">210</span>
<a name = "page210" id = "page210"> </a>
cap or fan charged with a lion passant, the whole being arched over by a
radiated ornament somewhat resembling a displayed fan, as in No. 375.
Similar Crests, somewhat modified in their details, are represented in
other seals of the same era, and with them the flowing Contoise or Scarf
is sometimes associated, as in No. 376, from the seal of Baron <span
class = "smallcaps">Henry de Perci</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1300. Similar ornaments were also placed by the
knights of those ages upon the heads of their chargers. The seal of
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry de Laci</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lincoln</span>, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1272,
shows the Fan-Crest both upon the helm of the Earl, No. 377, and the
head of his war-horse. Another equally characteristic example is the
Seal

observed that this knight displays the arms of his house, <a href =
"#fig134">No. 134</a>, upon his Shield, and also, in addition to the
Fan-Crest, upon the barding of his charger. Again I am indebted to the
kindness and liberality of Mr. Laing for the use of his admirable
woodcut of this fine and interesting seal.</p>

No. 379.&mdash; Helm of Thomas, second Earl of Lancaster.</p>

<p>The seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas</span>, second Earl of
<span class = "smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, about <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1320, gives an excellent example both of such
figures as were beginning at that early time to supersede the
Fan-Crests, and also of the Contoise; No. 379. About this same period
the fashion was introduced of fixing two tall spikes, one on each side
of the Crest, upon the helm, probably intended in the first instance to
display the contoise. These singular spikes may have been derived by the
English Heralds from their brethren of Germany, who
<span class = "pagenum">212</span>
<a name = "page212" id = "page212"> </a>
delighted, as they still delight, in placing upon helms as Crests, or as
the accessories of Crests, small banners displayed from staves set erect
and surmounted by spear-heads. In German Heraldry also Crests are very
frequently placed between tall upright horns or trumpets: and,
sometimes, upon a German helm the Crest stands between horns shaped like
two elephant’s trunks (for which they have often been mistaken by
English Heralds), placed in the same erect position, and, like the
trumpets, so adjusted as to have the general aspect of the curved
outline of a classic lyre. The helm of Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Geoffrey Luterell</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1345, No. 380, drawn from a celebrated
illumination, between the tall spikes has a late example of the
Fan-Crest; and it exemplifies the practice sometimes adopted of charging
armorial insignia upon Crests of this fan form. The Arms of
Luterell&mdash;<i>Or, a&nbsp;bend and six martlets sa.</i>&mdash;were
borne by Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Geoffrey</span> thus differenced
(E.&nbsp;2)&mdash;<i>Az., a&nbsp;bend and six martlets arg.</i> A pair
of lofty upright wings
<span class = "pagenum">213</span>
<a name = "page213" id = "page213"> </a>
were held in much esteem in the Heraldry of both England and Scotland,
to form the accessories of Crests. The Seal of Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Robert de Marny</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1366, No. 381, shows his armorial
shield&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;lion rampant arg.</i>, suspended from a
tree, between two crested helms, the crest in both cases being a
<i>winged chapeau</i>, having the wings very tall and very slender.</p>

<p>From the earliest times, Crests have occasionally been identical with
the principal charge in the Shield of Arms, or they have repeated the
principal charge with some slight modification of attitude or accessory:
but, more generally, Crests have been altogether distinct. The Dragon
and the Wyvern, the latter well exemplified in <a href = "#fig315">No.
315</a>, are amongst the earliest figures that were borne as Crests in
England. Other early Figure-Crests are the Lion, crowned and assumed for
the first time by an English Sovereign by <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>; and the Eagle, borne by the same
Prince. Various devices and figures are found gradually to have been
added to these earliest Crests. The graceful and peculiarly appropriate
<i>Panache</i> soon joined them, with the heads of various animals and
other creatures: and, as the fourteenth century advances, the
<i>Crest-Coronet</i>, <a href = "#fig232">No. 232</a>, the
<i>Crest-Wreath</i>, <a href = "#fig233">No. 233</a>, and the
<i>Chapeau</i>, <a href = "#fig224">No. 224</a>, assume their places in
connection with Crests; and the <i>Mantling</i> falls in rich folds from
them, covering the back of the Helm. In the succeeding century, with
Helms less dignified in form, but more elaborately enriched, and with
strangely fantastic Mantlings, Crests become considerably larger in
their proportions; and they often are extravagant in their character,
devices constantly being assumed and borne as Crests, which are no less
inconsistent with true heraldic feeling, than with the peculiar
conditions and the proper qualities of true heraldic Crests. The Crest
of the Duke of <span class = "smallcaps">Hamilton</span>, <a href =
"#fig301">No. 301</a>, is far from being one of the most inconsistent
devices that were intended to be worn
<span class = "pagenum">214</span>
<a name = "page214" id = "page214"> </a>
upon helms. And, as it is scarcely necessary for me to add, every really
consistent Crest should be such a figure or device as might be actually
worn upon his helm, by a mediæval knight, with dignity and with a happy
effect.</p>

No. 382.&mdash; Seal of William de Wyndesor.</p>

<p>Early examples of Panache-Crests exist in considerable numbers, and
they show much variety of treatment. <a href = "#fig285">No. 285</a>,
already given at page 142, shows a Panache of several heights of
feathers, the general outline having an oval contour. In <a href =
"#fig283">No. 283</a>, from the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward
de Courtenay</span>, Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Devon</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1372, there are three heights of
feathers, and the outline has a square form. Again, the Seal of <span
class = "smallcaps">William le Latimer</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1415, gives the peculiar Panache, with the no
less peculiar variety of mantling, shown in <a href = "#fig284">No.
284</a>. A&nbsp;Panache of ample proportions, and of exceedingly
graceful form, is represented in the Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">William de Wyndesor</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1381. The comparatively small size of the
armorial Shield, as it generally appears when introduced into the
composition of Seals in the fourteenth century, is shown in a striking
manner in this same example, No. 382, which in the woodcut is slightly
enlarged, in order to show the device more clearly: the arms
are&mdash;<i>Gu., a&nbsp;saltire or</i>. Other fine examples of
Panache-Crests may be seen in the effigies of Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard de Pembridge</span>, K.G., <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1375, in Hereford Cathedral; of Sir <span class

very fine effigy of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Edward de
Thorpe</span>, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1418, at
Ashwelthorpe, in Norfolk, has a helm of rare beauty of form, with a rich
mantling, and a most graceful Panache of peacock’s feathers; and
peacock’s feathers also form the Panache of Lord <span class =
"smallcaps">Ferrers</span> of <span class = "smallcaps">Chartley</span>,
in his Brass, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1425, at Merevale,
in Warwickshire. And, once more, upon the Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas de Hatfield</span>, Bishop of Durham, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1345, the Panache rises from the episcopal
mitre, after the same manner as it does in No. 383 from a Coronet.</p>

adjustment of the <i>Mantling</i> is shown. Two famous Lion-Crests are
those borne by the great families of <span class =
"smallcaps">Howard</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Percy</span>,
severally Dukes of Norfolk and Northumberland. The <span class =
"smallcaps">Howard</span> lion, originally granted by <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span> to <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas
Mowbray</span>, Earl Marshal, and now borne by the Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Norfolk</span>, is <i>a lion statant guardant, his tail
extended or, and ducally gorged arg.</i>: the <span class =
"smallcaps">Percy</span> lion is <i>statant, his tail extended or</i>:
each lion stands upon a chapeau. The Lion-Crest of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, being charged with the <i>silver
Label</i> (which he may be said to wear after the fashion of a collar),
exemplifies the prevailing practice of <i>differencing Crests with marks
of Cadency</i>. Crests admit every variety of Difference: and Mantlings
also are frequently differenced with small charges, or with badges; as
in the Garter-plate of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">John
Beaumont</span>, K.G., and in the Brass at Little Easton, Essex, to Sir
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry Bourchier</span>, K.G., Earl of <span
class = "smallcaps">Essex</span>.</p>

<p>The <i>Crest-Wreath</i> first appears about the middle of the
fourteenth century. The earliest example to which I can refer is
represented in the Brass to Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Hugh
Hastings</span>, at Elsyng, in Norfolk, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1347. In this most remarkable engraven
memorial, the finial of the principal canopy is surmounted by a helm
with mantling, wreath, and the crest of <span class =
"smallcaps">Hastings</span>&mdash;<i>a bull’s head sable</i>; No. 385.
In the effigy of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">R. de Pembridge</span>,
K.G., already noticed, the date of which is 1375, the crest is united to
the great helm that supports the head of the knight by a wreath formed
of a band of four-leaved flowers. A&nbsp;little later, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1384, at Southacre, in Norfolk, the Brass of
Sir <span class = "smallcaps">John Harsyck</span> has a
<span class = "pagenum">217</span>
<a name = "page217" id = "page217"> </a>
Crest-Wreath formed of two rolls, probably of silk, twisted as in No.
386. In the second half of the next century, amongst many good examples
of Crest-Wreaths I select as typical specimens those which appear in the
Brasses to Sir <span class = "smallcaps">William Vernon</span>, <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1467, at Tong, in Shropshire, No. 386;
and to Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Robert Harcourt</span>, K.G., No.
387, at Staunton Harcourt, Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>The Crest-Wreath in the form shown in the last examples, and now
almost universally used in representations of such Crests as are without
the Crest-Coronet and the Chapeau, may fairly be considered to have been
derived from the rich ornamentation, generally, as it would seem, formed
of costly textile fabrics, if not executed in jewelled or enamelled
goldsmith’s work, that was frequently wreathed about knightly basinets.
These wreath-like ornaments are represented in numerous effigies both
sculptured and engraven; and they are shown to have been worn either
flat, as in No. 388, or wrought to high relief, as in No. 389. These two
examples are severally from the effigies of a knight in Tewkesbury Abbey
Church, about <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1365, and of Sir
<span class = "smallcaps">Humphrey Stafford</span>, <span class =

<p>For many years after their first appearance, heraldic Crests were
regarded as insignia of great dignity and exalted estate; and it was not
till a considerably later period that the right to bear a Crest came to
be regarded as an adjunct of the right to bear arms. Still later, when
they were granted with Coat-Armour to corporate bodies, communities, and
institutions, Crests altogether lost their original significance; and
they became, in their use, Badges in everything except the habit of
placing them, with their accessories of Wreath or Crest-Coronet, of
Chapeau and Mantling, upon representations of helms.</p>

<p>When they were actually worn, Crests were undoubtedly constructed of
some very light materials. It is probable that <i>cuir bouilli</i>
(boiled leather), the decorative capabilities of which were so well
understood by mediæval artists, was generally employed.</p>

<p>It has been sometimes held that Crests are personal bearings only;
and, therefore, not hereditary, though capable of being bequeathed or
granted by their possessors. This theory is not sustained by early or
general usage; and,
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
<a name = "page219" id = "page219"> </a>
accordingly, Crests must be pronounced to be hereditary, as is
Coat-Armour.</p>

<p>It is evident that as one person may inherit, and therefore may
quarter, two or more Coats of Arms, so the same person might claim to
bear <i>two or more Crests</i> by a similar right of inheritance. This
in early times resulted in selection because no early British precedent
exists for the simultaneous display of <i>two</i> Crests. But it was
soon recognised that as no woman could bear a Crest, she ought not to
transmit one, and the idea of the inheritance of the Crest with a
quartering from a female ancestress ceased. At the present day, several
Crests, each with its own helm and mantling, are occasionally
represented above a Shield of arms: but, in England, by strict heraldic
rule, two (or more than two) Crests can be borne by one individual, only
when he has obtained the Royal licence to bear and use the <i>Surname
and Arms</i> of another family <i>in addition</i> to those of his own
family, or, by a special grant from the Crown.</p>

<p class = "first">
A <span class = "smallcaps">Badge</span>, like a Coat of Arms, is an
armorial ensign that is complete in itself, and possesses a definite
signification of its own. In use with a decided heraldic significance
long before the adoption of systematic Heraldry, Badges have always held
a conspicuous position in the estimation of Heralds. A&nbsp;Badge
resembles any single charge in Heraldry, in being a figure or device
that is assumed as the distinctive cognisance of a particular individual
or family: but, unlike a charge, it may be borne by itself, without any
Shield, and also without any accompanying accessory, with the exception,
in some instances, of a <i>Motto</i> (See “Motto,” <a href =
"#page138">p. 138</a>). Badges, however, are found depicted on roundels
of the livery, and upon Standards, and for decorative purposes are often
depicted upon mantlings. It will be evident that a Badge may be the very
same figure or device as a Crest; but, it must be remembered that a
Badge always differs from a Crest, in usually being altogether without
crest-wreath or coronet, in consequence of having no connection whatever
with the knightly helm. There was, however, a&nbsp;period in which the
Badge was much confused with the Crest, which has resulted in many
devices which are really Crests being officially recorded as Badges.</p>

<p>After the establishment of a true Heraldry, Badges were generally
used to commemorate remarkable exploits, or in
<span class = "pagenum">221</span>
<a name = "page221" id = "page221"> </a>
reference either to some family or feudal alliance, or to indicate some
territorial rights or pretensions. Very many Badges are allusive, and
consequently they are <i>Rebuses</i> (see “Rebus,” <a href =
"#page146">p. 146</a>). Some are taken from the charges of the bearer’s
Shield, or they have a more or less direct reference to those charges.
Some trace of Marshalling or of feudal Difference may constantly be
observed in Badges; and even where the motive for the selection of
certain devices has not been discovered, it may fairly be assumed that a
good heraldic motive still exists, although it has become obscured or
been forgotten. It was not uncommon for the same personage or family to
use more than one Badge; and, on the other hand, two or more Badges were
often borne in combination, to form a single compound device, as in Nos.
<a href = "#fig235">235</a> and <a href = "#fig270">270</a>. The
<i>ragged staff</i>, in like manner, <a href = "#fig294">No. 294</a>,
and the <i>bear</i>, both of them Badges of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Beauchamps</span>, Earls of <span class =
"smallcaps">Warwick</span>, were sometimes united to form a single
Badge, and by the successors of that great family the “bear and ragged
staff” were generally borne as a single device. (See <a href =
"#fig448">No. 448</a>, and <a href = "#page319">p. 319</a>.)</p>

<p>Two distinct classes of Badges were in general use in the fourteenth,
fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries. Those of the first class, well known
as the insignia of certain eminent personages and powerful houses, were
borne by all the followers, retainers, dependants, and partisans of
those personages and houses: and they were so borne by them, and they
were used by their owners for every variety of decorative purpose,
because they were <i>known and understood</i>; and, consequently,
because the presence of these Badges would cause all persons and objects
bearing them to be readily and certainly distinguished. By means of
these most useful devices a wide and comprehensive range was given to
the action and the influence of true Heraldry, without infringing in the
slightest degree upon the lofty and almost sacred exclusiveness of the
Coat-Armour of a noble or
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
<a name = "page222" id = "page222"> </a>
a gentle house. In the words which <span class =
"smallcaps">Shakespeare</span> teaches <span class =
"smallcaps">Clifford</span> to address to <span class =
"smallcaps">Warwick</span>, “Might I but know thee by thy household
Badge!” it is implied that all the followers of Warwick were well known
by his “household Badge,” which was displayed by them all, while some
other insignia were worn by the great Earl upon his own person.</p>

<p>Mr. Lower has remarked (“Curiosities of Heraldry,” p. 145) that
“something analogous to the fashion” of embroidering the household
Badges of their lords “upon the sleeves or breasts” of the dependants of
great families in the olden times, “is retained in the Crest which
adorns the buttons of our domestic servants.” The accomplished writer
might have added that, in thus employing <i>Crests</i> to discharge
<i>Badge</i>-duties, we are content to indulge a love for heraldic
display without observing becoming heraldic distinctions. Crested livery
buttons are heraldic anomalies under all circumstances&mdash;even the
head of a house himself, if he were a Herald, would not display his
Crest, as a Crest, upon buttons to be used exclusively by himself.
Crests are to be borne on helms, or represented as being borne on helms:
Badges are decorative insignia, and fulfil with consistent significance
their own distinct and appropriate functions.</p>

<p>Badges of the second class were devices that were borne exclusively
by the exalted personages who were pleased to assume them, often for
temporary use only, and generally with some subtle or latent
significance, which had been studiously rendered difficult to be
detected, and dubious in its application.</p>

<p>These Badges, thus displayed rather to effect disguise or to excite
curiosity than to secure recognition, must be regarded for the most part
as the expressions of heraldic revelry&mdash;as the fantasies and
eccentricities of an age, which loved to combine quaint conceits and
symbolical allusions with the display of gorgeous magnificence.
Accordingly,
<span class = "pagenum">223</span>
<a name = "page223" id = "page223"> </a>
Badges of this order are found generally to have been assumed on the
occasion of the jousts or Hastiludes, the masques, and other pageants
that in feudal times were celebrated with so much of elaborate and
brilliant splendour.</p>

<p>The adoption of Badges of this peculiar character is exactly in
keeping with the sentiment which prompted men of exalted rank and
eminent distinction to appear in public, on occasions of high festivity,
bearing the arms of some friend, kinsman, or ally, instead of their own.
A&nbsp;mark of especial favour and of peculiar distinction would be
conferred, when a Sovereign or a Prince thus would display upon his own
person the armory of some honoured subject or comrade. <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> delighted thus to honour the most
distinguished cavaliers of his chivalrous Court. For example, in or
about the year 1347, royal Hastiludes were celebrated at Lichfield with
great splendour, the jousters consisting of the <span class =
"smallcaps">King</span> and seventeen Knights, and the Earl of <span
class = "smallcaps">Lancaster</span> and thirteen Knights.
A&nbsp;conspicuous part was taken in these festivities by the King’s
daughter <span class = "smallcaps">Isabelle</span>, afterwards Countess
of <span class = "smallcaps">Bedford</span>, and by six Ladies of high
rank, with twenty-one other Ladies, who all wore blue dresses and white
hoods of the same materials as well as the same colours as the robes of
the Knights, together with various masks or vizors. On this occasion,
the <span class = "smallcaps">King</span> himself over his armour wore a
surcoat with the Arms of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas de
Bradestone</span>. These Arms in a Roll of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> are blazoned as&mdash;<i>Arg., on a
canton gu. a&nbsp;rose or</i> (see <i>Archæologia</i>, xxxi., pp. 40 and
118). On another occasion, during Hastiludes at Canterbury, <span class
= "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> “is said to have given eight
harnesses, worked with the arms of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Stephen
de Cosynton</span> (<i>az., three roses arg.</i>), to the <span class =
"smallcaps">Prince of Wales</span>, the Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, and six other Knights.” In the same
spirit, <span class = "smallcaps">Richard de Beauchamp</span>, Earl of
<span class = "smallcaps">Warwick</span>, at a great festival of arms
held at Calais under
<span class = "pagenum">224</span>
<a name = "page224" id = "page224"> </a>
his presidency, on the first day entered the lists decorated with the
arms of his ancestor the Lord <span class = "smallcaps">Toney</span>: on
the second day, he wore the arms of Hanslap: and, on the third day, “he
appeared as the Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Warwick</span>,
quartering Beauchamp, Guy, Hanslap, and Toney, on his trappings; his
vizor open, and the chaplet on his helm enriched with pearls and
precious stones.” In such times, Badges of curious device and occult
signification could not fail to enjoy a popularity, not the less decided
because of the restricted use and exclusive character of the Badges
themselves.</p>

"smallcaps">Nevilles</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Dudleys</span>, I&nbsp;have already noticed. Seals
frequently have Badges introduced upon them, in very early times, by
themselves, the Badge in each case constituting the device of the Seal
(see <a href = "#page193">p. 193</a>). The Secretum or private Seal of
<span class = "smallcaps">Robert Bruce</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Carrick</span>, the father of the King, appended to the
homage-deed extorted by <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>

Mr. Laing’s beautiful woodcuts. Badges also constantly appear upon Seals
in association with Shields of arms. Thus, a&nbsp;Seal of one of the
<span class = "smallcaps">Berkeleys</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span> 1430, has a mermaid on each side of an armorial
shield. Two other examples of this kind I have already given: No. 318,
the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Joan de Barre</span>, which is
charged with the <i>castle</i> and <i>lion</i> of Castile
<span class = "pagenum">225</span>

and Leon, as Badges: and <a href = "#fig321">No. 321</a>, the Seal of
<span class = "smallcaps">Oliver de Bohun</span>, charged, about the
Shield, with the Bohun <i>Swan</i>. On his Seal, No. 391, Sir <span
class = "smallcaps">Walter de Hungerford</span>, K.G., Lord of <span
class = "smallcaps">Heytesbury</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Homet</span> (the latter a Norman barony), displays his own
Badge, the <i>sickle</i>, in happy alliance with the <i>garb</i> of
Peverel (borne by him in right of his wife, <span class =
"smallcaps">Catherine</span>, daughter and co-heir of <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas Peverel</span>), to form his Crest. The Crest, it
will be observed, in No. 391, is <i>a garb between two sickles</i>. The
Shield of Hungerford only&mdash;<i>sa. two bars arg., and in chief three
plates</i>, is also placed between <i>two sickles</i>. Two banners,
denoting important alliances, complete the Heraldry of this remarkable
composition: the banner to the dexter, for Heytesbury,
bears&mdash;<i>per pale indented gu. and vert., a&nbsp;chevron or</i>;
and that to the sinister, for Hussy&mdash;<i>barry of six erm. and
gu.</i> Lord <span class = "smallcaps">Hungerford</span> died in 1449,

him during the lifetime of his father, precisely the same in its
heraldic composition as his father’s Seal, is remarkable from having
<i>each of its four sickles differenced with an ermine-spot upon the

that a label of three points was charged upon the Shield, and upon each
of the two banners; No. 392.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Badges</span> of our early Heraldry are
comparatively but little understood. They invite the particular
attention of students, both from their own special interest, and the
light they are qualified to throw upon the personal history of the
<span class = "pagenum">227</span>
<a name = "page227" id = "page227"> </a>
English people, and also from their peculiar applicability for use by
ourselves at the present day. Indeed, at this time, when the revival of
true Heraldry is in the act of being accomplished with complete success,
it appears to be peculiarly desirable that Badges should be brought into
general use. It is not enough for us to revive our old English Heraldry
as once in the olden time it flourished in England, and to rest content
with such a revival: but we must go on to adapt our revived Heraldry, in
its own spirit and in full sympathy with its genuine feeling, to
conditions of our age and of the state of things now in existence. And
very much may be done to effect this by the adoption of Badges, as our
favourite and most expressive heraldic insignia, both in connection with
Coat-Armour and for independent display. Unlike Crests, which must
necessarily be associated with helms and the wearers of helms, and
consequently have both a military and a mediæval character, Badges are
equally appropriate for use by Ladies, as well as by men of every
profession, and they belong alike to every age and period. This has been
recognised officially, to the extent that the officers of arms have now
reverted to the ancient practice of granting and confirming badges and
Standards.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Royal Badges.</span>&mdash;I conclude this
chapter with a concise list of the more important of the Badges that
have been borne by the Sovereigns and Princes of England; and with some
general remarks upon the famous Badge of the <i>Ostrich Feathers</i>,
now considered to be exclusively the Ensign of the <span class =

heirs-apparent to the Throne.</p>

<p>The <i>Planta-genista</i>, or Broom-plant, <a href = "#fig21">No.

derived from it for one of the most remarkable
<span class = "pagenum">228</span>
<a name = "page228" id = "page228"> </a>
of the Royal Houses that ever have flourished in Europe.</p>

<p>As well known are the <i>Rose</i>, <i>Thistle</i>, and

<p>From this time distinctive personal Badges ceased to be borne by
English Sovereigns. But various badges have become stereotyped and now
form a constituent part of
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>

the Royal Arms, and will be found recited later in <a href =

<p>The <i>Ostrich Feather Badge</i>. The popular tradition, that the
famous Badge of the Ostrich Feathers was won from the blind <span class
= "smallcaps">King of Bohemia</span> at Cressi by the <span class =
"smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, and by him afterwards borne as an
heraldic trophy, is not supported by any contemporary authority. The
earliest writer by whom the tradition itself is recorded is <span class
= "smallcaps">Camden</span> (<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
1614), and his statement is confirmed by no known historical evidence of
a date earlier than his own work. As Sir <span class = "smallcaps">N.
Harris Nicholas</span> has shown in a most able paper in the
<i>Archæologia</i> (vol. xxxi. pp. 350-384), the first time the Feathers
are mentioned in any record is in a document, the date of which must
have been after 1369, and which contains lists of plate belonging to the
King himself, and also to Queen <span class =
"smallcaps">Phillipa</span>. It is particularly to be observed, that all
the pieces of plate specified in this roll as the personal property of
the Queen, if marked with any device at all, are marked with her <i>own
initial</i>, or with some heraldic insignia that have a direct reference
to <i>herself</i>. One of these pieces of plate is described as “a large
dish for the alms of the Queen, of silver gilt, and enamelled at the
bottom with <i>a black escutcheon with Ostrich Feathers</i>&mdash;<i>eym
in fund vno scuch nigro cum pennis de ostrich</i>.” And these “Ostrich
Feathers,” thus blazoned on a sable field upon the silver alms-dish of
Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Philippa</span>, Sir N.&nbsp;H. Nicholas
believed to have been borne by the Queen as a daughter of the House of
<span class = "smallcaps">Hainault</span>; and he suggested that these
same “Ostrich Feathers” might possibly have been assumed by the Counts
of the Province of Hainault from the Comté of Ostrevant, which formed
the appanage of their eldest sons.</p>

Cathedral; or, two Feathers were placed side by side, as they also
appear upon the same monument. In Seals, or when marshalled with a
Shield of Arms, two Feathers are seen to have been placed after the
manner of Supporters, one on each side of the composition: in such
examples the tips of the Feathers droop severally to the dexter and
sinister: in all the early examples also the Feathers droop in the same
manner, or they incline slightly towards the spectator. Three Feathers
were first grouped together by <span class = "smallcaps">Arthur

<p>The Ostrich Feathers were borne, as a Badge with his Shield of Arms,
upon one Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>
himself: they were used, as an heraldic device, about the year 1370, by
<span class = "smallcaps">Philippa</span>, his Queen: they appear on
some, but not on all, the Seals of the <span class = "smallcaps">Black
Prince</span>, and they are omitted from some of his Seals after the
battle of Cressi (<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1346): and they
were also borne, generally with some slight difference, marking Cadency,
in all probability by all the other sons of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>&mdash;certainly by <span class =
"smallcaps">John of Ghent</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancaster</span>, and by <span class = "smallcaps">Thomas of
Woodstock</span>, Duke
<span class = "pagenum">233</span>
<a name = "page233" id = "page233"> </a>
of <span class = "smallcaps">Gloucester</span>. They were adopted by
<span class = "smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;II.</span>, and placed on either
side of his crested Helm in the heraldic sculpture of Westminster Hall,
as appears in two of these beautiful examples, Nos. <a href =
"#fig199">199</a> and <a href = "#fig384">384</a>: by this Prince the
Ostrich Feathers were placed on his first Royal Seal, and they were
habitually used for decoration and heraldic display; and they also were
formally granted by him, as a mark of especial favour, to be borne as an
Augmentation of the highest honour, to his cousin <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas Mowbray</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Norfolk</span>. The Ostrich Feathers were borne, in like
manner, by the succeeding Princes, both <span class =
"smallcaps">Lancastrian</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Yorkist</span>: by at least two of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Beauforts</span>: by the Princes of the House of <span class
= "smallcaps">Tudor</span>: and by their successors the <span class =
"smallcaps">Stuarts</span>. Thus, it is certain that the Ostrich
Feathers were held to be a <i>Royal Badge</i>, from the time of their
first appearance in the Heraldry of England about the middle of the
fourteenth century; and that in that character they were adopted and
borne by the successive Sovereigns, and by the Princes, sometimes also
by the Princesses (as in the instance of a Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Margaret Beaufort</span>, the mother of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VII.</span>), of the Royal Houses, without any
other distinction than some slight mark of Cadency, and without the
slightest trace of any peculiar association with any one member of the
Royal Family. From the time of the accession of the House of Stuart to
the Crown of the United Kingdom, however, the coroneted plume of three
Ostrich Feathers appears to have been regarded, as it is at this present
day, as the special Badge of the Heir to the Throne.</p>

<p>In accordance with the express provision of his will, two armorial
Shields are displayed upon the monument of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Black Prince</span> in Canterbury Cathedral, which Shields
the Prince himself distinguishes as his Shields “for War” and “for
Peace”; the former charged with his quartered arms of France and England
differenced with his silver
<span class = "pagenum">234</span>
<a name = "page234" id = "page234"> </a>
Label, <a href = "#fig337">No. 337</a>; and the latter, <i>sable</i>,
charged with <i>three Ostrich Feathers argent</i>, their quills passing
through scrolls bearing the Motto, “<i>Ich Diene</i>” No. 401. The same
motto is placed over each of the Shields that are charged with the
Feathers, as in No. 401: and over each Shield charged with the quartered
arms (there are on each side of the tomb six Shields, three of the Arms,
and three of the Feathers, alternately) is the other motto of the
Prince, “<i>Houmout</i>.” In his will, the <span class =
"smallcaps">Black Prince</span> also desired that a “<i>black Pennon
with Ostrich Feathers</i>” should be displayed at his Funeral; and he
further appointed that his Chapel in Canterbury Cathedral should be
adorned in various places with his Arms, and “<i>likewise with our Badge
of Ostrich Feathers&mdash;noz bages dez plumes d’ostruce</i>.”</p>

<p>The will of the <span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span> proves
the Feathers to have been a Badge, and not either a Crest or the ensign
of a Shield of Arms, since twice he expressly calls them “<i>our
Badge</i>”: and it also is directly opposed to the traditional warlike
origin and military character of the Feathers, as a Badge of the <span
class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, for it particularly specifies
the peaceful significance of this Badge, and distinguishes it from the
insignia that were worn and displayed by the Prince
<span class = "pagenum">235</span>
<a name = "page235" id = "page235"> </a>
when he was equipped for war. The Mottoes “<i>Ich Diene</i>” and
“<i>Houmout</i>” are old German, and they signify, “I serve,” and
“magnanimous.” It has been suggested by Mr. Planché, that “Houmout” is
Flemish, and that the three words really form a single Motto,
signifying, “Magnanimous, I&nbsp;serve,” that is, “I obey the dictates
of magnanimity” (<i>Archæologia</i>, xxxii. 69).</p>

<p>Upon a very remarkable Seal, used by <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span> a short time before his accession, the
shield with helm and crest are placed between two tall Feathers, about
each of which is entwined <i>a Garter</i> charged with his favourite and
significant Motto&mdash;the word SOVEREYGNE, as in No. 402. His father,
Prince <span class = "smallcaps">John of Ghent</span>, placed <i>a
chain</i> upon the quills of his Feathers, as in the very curious boss
in the cloisters at Canterbury. The uncle of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span>, <span class =
"smallcaps">Thomas</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Gloucester</span>, on one of his Seals, differenced his two
Feathers with <i>Garters</i> (probably of the
<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<a name = "page236" id = "page236"> </a>
Order) displayed along their quills, as in No. 403. And, about <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1440, <span class = "smallcaps">John
Beaufort</span>, K.G., Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Somerset</span>, on his Garter-plate placed two Ostrich
Feathers erect, their <i>quills componée argent and azure</i>, and fixed
in golden escrolls; No. 404. In the Harleian MS. 304, f. 12, it is
stated that the Ostrich Feather of silver, the pen thus componée argent
and azure, “is the Duke of Somerset’s”: also that the “Feather silver,
with the pen gold, is the King’s: the Ostrich Feather, pen and all
silver, is the Prince’s: and the Ostrich Feather gold, the pen ermine,
is the Duke of Lancaster’s.”</p>

<p>The Shield charged with three Ostrich Feathers, <a href =
"#fig401">No. 401</a>, was borne by Prince <span class =
"smallcaps">John of Ghent</span>; and it appears on the splendid Great
Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span>, between the
Shields of the Duchy of <span class = "smallcaps">Cornwall</span> and
the Earldom of <span class = "smallcaps">Chester</span>. <span class =
"smallcaps">Humphrey</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Gloucester</span>, is also recorded to have borne this same
Feather Shield.</p>

<p>In the Vaulting of the ceiling over the steps leading to the Hall at
Christchurch, Oxford, the Ostrich Plume Badge is carved within a Garter
of the Order: and, again, the Badge is represented after the same
manner, environed with the Garter, in the beautiful binding of a copy of
the Bible which is reputed to have been used by <span class =
"smallcaps">Charles&nbsp;I.</span> in his last moments.</p>

<p>The Ostrich Feathers are repeatedly mentioned in early documents; and
they are shown to have been constantly used for various decorative
purposes, always evidently with an heraldic motive and feeling, by the
same Royal personages who blazoned them on their Seals, and displayed
them elsewhere as their armorial insignia. A&nbsp;well-known example of
a diaper of White Ostrich Feathers on a field per pale argent and vert,
is preserved in the stained glass now in the great north window of the
transept of Canterbury Cathedral.</p>

A <span class = "smallcaps">supporter</span> is a figure, sometimes of
an angel, frequently of a human being, but more generally of some
animal, bird, or imaginary creature, so placed in connection with a
Shield of Arms as to appear to be protecting and supporting it. In
English Heraldry a single Supporter is of comparatively rare occurrence,
but a number of examples are to be found in the Heraldry of Scotland. In
early examples, when two Supporters appear, they are in most cases
alike: but, more recently (except in the Heraldry of France), the two
figures are generally quite distinct the one from the other, the earlier
usage of having the two Supporters alike being less frequent. The modern
prevailing practice in England is happily exemplified in the well-known
instance of the present Royal Supporters, the Lion and the Unicorn.</p>

<p>Supporters are considered to have been introduced into the Heraldry
of England during the reign of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span>; but they may with greater accuracy
be assigned to the middle of the fifteenth century, than to the second
half of the fourteenth. As armorial insignia of a very high rank,
Supporters are granted in England only by the express command of the
Sovereign, except to Peers and Knights Grand Cross and Knights Grand
Commanders. In Scotland, where they occur more frequently than in
<span class = "pagenum">238</span>
<a name = "page238" id = "page238"> </a>
the Heraldry of the South of the Tweed, the “Lord Lyon” has power to
grant Supporters. Originally by the Scottish Heralds these accessories
of Shields were entitled “Bearers.”</p>

<p>Supporters are now granted, on payment of fees, to all Peers of the
Realm to descend to the holders of a specified Peerage, and to Knights
of the Garter, Thistle, and St. Patrick, and to Knights Grand Cross and
Knights Grand Commanders of all other orders of knighthood to be borne
for life. Most Nova Scotia Baronets and Chiefs of Scottish Clans have
supporters registered with their arms.</p>

<p>Supporters probably owe their origin rather to several concurrent
circumstances, than to any one particular circumstance. The mere fact of
a Knight carrying his own armorial Shield, or his Esquire bearing it
beside him, might suggest the general idea of some <i>supporting</i>
figure in connection with a representation of that Shield. The act of
carrying a Banner of Arms, in like manner, might suggest a
representation of a “Supporter” for a Shield of Arms. To early Seals,
however, Heraldry is in an especial degree indebted for the development
of the idea of Supporters, and for bringing it into a definite form.
Again, the prevalent use of Badges in the fourteenth century, and in the
fifteenth also, would necessarily exercise a powerful influence in the
same direction; and would lead Heralds to associate with Shields of Arms
certain other figures which, while in themselves distinct and
independent, were closely allied with certain Shields of Arms. The
prototypes of true Supporters, indeed, as they appear on Seals, are
Badges. In fact, it is often difficult to determine whether specified
figures on the Seals of a certain period are heraldic supporters or
merely representations of Badges.</p>

<p>An Effigy represented upon a Seal, as in No. 405, the
<span class = "pagenum">239</span>
<a name = "page239" id = "page239"> </a>
Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Devorguilla Crawford</span>, about
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1290, from <span class =
"smallcaps">Laing’s</span> Volume: or in Nos. 316, 317, would be even
more than a suggestion of a Supporter. The same may be said, when some
figure, almost certainly a Badge, was introduced into the composition of
a Seal, holding or supporting a Shield by its guige, as in <a href =
"#fig203">No. 203</a>; or when a Shield, or two or more Shields, were
charged upon some figure, as in <a href = "#fig204">No. 204</a>: both of
these examples, indeed, might be regarded as illustrations of the origin
or first adoption of single Supporters.</p>

<p>The introduction of angelic figures, which might have the appearance
of acting as “Guardian Angels,” in their care of Shields of Arms, was in
accordance with the feeling of the early days of English Heraldry; and,
while it took a part in leading the way to the systematic use of regular
Supporters, it served to show the high esteem and honour in which
armorial insignia were held by our ancestors of those ages. In <a href =
"#fig159">No. 159</a> I have already shown an example of a sculptured
Shield thus supported by Angels, from St. Albans. In the same noble
church there are other examples of the same character in stained glass.
Angel Supporters, the figures treated in various ways, occur in very
many Gothic edifices; particularly, sculptured as corbels, bosses or
pateræ, or introduced in panels, and employed for the decoration of open
timber roofs, as in Westminster Hall. They appear also on Seals; as on
the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry of Lancaster</span>, about
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1350, which has the figure of an
Angel above the Shield, and a lion on each side of&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>The representation of armorial Banners upon Seals would lead to at
least the occasional introduction of some figure to hold, or
<i>support</i>, the Banner; and here, again, we
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
discern the presence of some of the immediate predecessors of
“Supporters,” properly so called. In the Seals, Nos. <a href =
"#fig391">391</a>, <a href = "#fig392">392</a>, the Banners are not
supported, and yet they are indirectly suggestive of giving support to
the Shield which is marshalled with them in the same composition.
Another Hungerford Seal, that of <span class = "smallcaps">Margaret
Botreaux</span>, widow of the second Baron <span class =
"smallcaps">Hungerford</span> (who died in 1477), in the centre of the
composition has a kneeling figure of the noble lady, and on each side a
banner of arms is held (<i>supported</i>) erect, so that the two banners
form a kind of canopy over her head, by a lion and a gryphon. In No. 406
I give a part only of this elaborate Seal, sufficient to show how its
general composition bears upon the adoption of Supporters. The Monument
in Westminster Abbey of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Ludovic
Robsart</span>, K.G., Lord <span class = "smallcaps">Bourchier</span>,
Standard-Bearer to <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;V.</span> at
Agincourt, has two banners sculptured in the stone work of the canopy,
which are placed precisely in the same manner as the banners in No. 406;
and, like them, they are held by Badges acting as Supporters. Two
well-known seals of the <span class = "smallcaps">Percies</span> are
charged with banners, and
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
in each case the banner-staff is held by a single Supporter: one of
these figures is a man-at-arms, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
1386; the other is a lion, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1446.
At the same period, two lions appear on another Percy Seal. Another, of
the same date, has the shield supported by an armed man, without any
banner, but having a lance with a long pennon charged with the Crescent
badge of <span class = "smallcaps">Percy</span>, <a href = "#fig412">No.
412</a>, p. 247. Other Percy Seals, again, of the fourteenth century, on
either side of the Shield have two lions or two birds.</p>

<p>Numerous examples of great interest illustrate the early introduction
of Badges into the composition of Seals, as accessories of Shields.
A&nbsp;Seal of Prince <span class = "smallcaps">John of Ghent</span>,
which has two falcons and padlocks, is one of the most beautiful and
suggestive works of its class: in this Seal the two birds are addorsed,
and consequently they also have their backs turned towards the central
achievement. This position of the figures on early Seals is not
uncommon; but it is an illustration that the use of Badges in the form
from which they developed into supporters was an artistic necessity,
arising from the form of the spaces to be occupied by the figures upon
the Seal. Another most characteristic example of that marshalling of
Badges upon Seals, which certainly led the way to true Supporters, is
the Seal of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Maurice de Berkeley</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1430, upon which <i>a
mermaid</i>&mdash;the Berkeley badge&mdash;is blazoned on each side of
the Shield. The two figures are drawn with much skill and elegance. The
Shield itself quarters <i>Berkeley</i> within a bordure, and a
differenced coat of <i>Bottetourt</i>: it hangs from a large helm,
which, in its turn, is ensigned by as large a <i>mitre</i>&mdash;the
singular Crest of the Berkeleys. The two figures, generally animals,
which fill up the spaces to the dexter and sinister of the central
achievement on Seals, in the fifteenth century are almost invariably
drawn of a comparatively large size; and, for the most part, they really
act as <i>Supporters to the Crested Helm</i>, being themselves
<i>supported by
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
the Shield</i>. The composition of the Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edmund de Mortimer</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">March</span>, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1400,
though now mutilated, exhibits in a most satisfactory manner this very
effective arrangement, from which true Supporters to a Shield of Arms
might obviously be derived. In this Seal, No. 407, the Shield quarters
<i>Mortimer</i>, <a href = "#fig131">No. 131</a>, and&mdash;<i>or,
a&nbsp;cross gu.</i>, for <i>Ulster</i>. The Seal of <span class =
"smallcaps">Wm. de Wyndesor</span>, <a href = "#fig382">No. 382</a>,
illustrates with no less happy effect the occasional use of birds
instead of beasts, as Supporting Badges. Other examples exist in great
numbers, and in abundant variety: the two that I add from Mr. Laing’s
Volume, Nos. 408 and 409, are in every respect most characteristic; they
are severally the Seals of <span class = "smallcaps">Robert
Graham</span>, of Kinpont, and of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">William
Lindsay</span>, of the Byres.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary for me to point out to students that
Supporters always have a decided heraldic significance. In supporting a
Shield of Arms, they discharge an heraldic duty: but, in themselves,
Supporters are armorial symbols
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
of a high rank; and, with peculiar emphasis, they record descent,
inheritance, and alliance, and they blazon illustrious deeds.</p>

<p>Supporters should always be represented in an erect position. In
whatever direction also they actually may be looking, they always ought
to appear to fulfil their own proper office of giving vigilant and
deferential <i>support to the Shield</i>. It would be well, in our
blazoning of supported Achievements, not only for us to regard a
becoming position and attitude for Supporters to be matters determined
by positive heraldic law, but also that some satisfactory arrangement
should be made and recognised for general adoption, by which an equally
becoming <i>support</i> would be provided for “Supporters.” An
unsatisfactory custom has been either to place the Supporters, whatever
they may be, upon some very slight renaissance scroll work that is
neither graceful nor consistent, or, to constrain the Motto scroll to
provide a foundation or standing-place for them. In the latter case, an
energetic lion, or a massive elephant, and, in a certain class of
achievements of comparatively recent date, a&nbsp;mounted trooper, or a
stalwart man-of-war’s man, probably with a twenty-four pounder at his
feet, are made to stand on <i>the edge of the ribbon</i> that is
inscribed with the Motto. Mr. Laing has enabled me to give an excellent
example of
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
Supporters&mdash;two lions standing upon a motto-scroll or
ribbon&mdash;in No. 410, the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">John
Drummond</span>, created Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Melfort</span> and Viscount <span class =
"smallcaps">Forth</span> in the year 1686: the Shield is <i>Scotland,
within a bordure componée</i>; the Supporters are gorged with collars
charged with thistles; and the Crest is the Crest of Scotland issuing
from a celestial Crown. As says the Motto of Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">William Mahon</span>, “<i>Moniti, meliora
sequamur</i>”&mdash;now that we have been told of it, let us produce
something better than this support for our Supporters. Happily the best
heraldic artists of the moment seem very generally to have reverted to
the older and more preferable form.</p>

<p>The Heralds of France still restrict the term
“Supporters”&mdash;“<i>Les Supports</i>”&mdash;to animals; whilst to
human beings, to figures of angels, and to mythological personages or
other figures in human form, when supporting a Shield, they apply the
term “<i>Les Tenants</i>.” When trees or other inanimate objects are
placed beside any armorial shield, and so discharge the duty of
Supporters in French achievements, they are distinguished as “<i>Les
Soutiens</i>.” An old French writer on Heraldry, <span class =
"smallcaps">Palliot</span>, however, says that in his time (<span class
= "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1660), <i>Tenant</i> is used in the singular
number, and
<span class = "pagenum">245</span>
<a name = "page245" id = "page245"> </a>
denotes any kind of <i>single Supporter</i>, while <i>Supports</i> is
used when there are <i>two</i>.</p>

<p>In the French Heraldry of the present time, a&nbsp;single Tenant or
Support is of rare occurrence; and when two Tenants or Supports appear
in blazon, they are generally, though not always, alike.</p>

are inseparably associated with spirit-stirring memories, and in all
ages and with every people they enjoy an enthusiastic popularity
peculiar to themselves.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages, in England, three distinct classes of heraldic
Flags appear to have been in general use, each class having a distinct
and well-defined signification.</p>

<p>1. First, the <span class = "smallcaps">Pennon</span>, small in size,
of elongated form, and either pointed or swallow-tailed at the
extremity, is charged with the Badge or some other armorial ensign of
the owner, and by him displayed upon his own lance, as his personal
ensign. The Pennon of Sir <span class = "smallcaps">John
d’Abernoun</span>, <a href = "#fig286">No. 286</a>, fringed and pointed,
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1277, bears his
arms&mdash;<i>Az., a&nbsp;chevron or</i>: and No. 411, another example
of the pointed form of Pennon, is from the Painted Chamber, Westminster,
about <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1275. No. 412, a&nbsp;long
swallow-tailed Pennon, charged with the Percy crescent Badge, is from
the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry de Perci</span>, first Earl
of <span class = "smallcaps">Northumberland</span>.
<span class = "pagenum">247</span>
<a name = "page247" id = "page247"> </a>
Before the true heraldic era, <i>Lance-Flags</i> with various decorative
devices, but without any blazonry having a definite signification, were
in use: See Nos. <a href = "#fig5">5</a>, <a href = "#fig6">6</a>. The
<i>Pennoncelle</i> was a modification of the Pennon.</p>

<p>2. Second, the <span class = "smallcaps">Banner</span>, square or
oblong in form, and of a larger size than the Pennon, bears the entire
Coat of Arms of the owner blazoned over its whole surface, precisely as
the same composition is blazoned upon a Shield: <a href = "#fig162">No.
162</a>. The Banner has been described as the ensign of the Sovereign,
or of a Prince, a&nbsp;Noble, or a Knight who had been advanced to the
higher rank or degree of a “Banneret”; but it would seem almost certain
that the display of Arms upon a Banner was never confined to a Banneret.
Two Banners are represented in each of the Hungerford Seals, Nos.
<a href = "#fig391">391</a>, <a href = "#fig392">392</a>. A&nbsp;small
group of oblong Banners, with two pointed Pennons, is represented in No.
413, from the Painted Chamber.</p>

<p>In the olden time, when a Knight had distinguished himself by
conspicuous gallantry, it was the custom to mark his meritorious conduct
by prompt advancement on the very field of battle. In such a case, the
point or points of the good Knight’s Pennon were rent off, and thus the
<span class = "pagenum">248</span>
<a name = "page248" id = "page248"> </a>
small Flag was reduced to the <i>square</i> form of the Banner, by which
thenceforth he was to be distinguished. <span class =
"smallcaps">Froissart</span>, in his own graphic manner, has described
the ceremonial which attended the first display of the Banner of a
newly-created Banneret on the field of battle. Sir <span class =
"smallcaps">John Chandos</span>, one of the Knights Founders of the
Garter, appeared with his maiden Banner on the field, on the morning of
the battle of Naveret, in Castile, April 3rd, 1367:&mdash;“He brought
his banner in his hands,” says the chronicler, “rolled up” (rolled round
the staff), “and said to the <span class = "smallcaps">Prince of
Wales</span>”&mdash;it was the <span class = "smallcaps">Black
Prince</span>,&mdash;“’My Lord, behold, here is my Banner:
I&nbsp;deliver it to you in this way,”&mdash;still rolled round the
staff, that is&mdash;“’that it may please you to display it, and that
this day I may raise it; for, thank God, I&nbsp;have land and heritage
sufficient to support the rank as it ought to be!’ Then the Prince and
the King”&mdash;Don <span class = "smallcaps">Petro</span>, King of
Castile&mdash;“took the Banner, which was of silver with a sharp pile
gules, between their hands by the staff, and displayed it, and returned
it to him, the Prince saying&mdash;’Sir John, behold your Banner; may
God grant you may do your duty!’ Then Sir <span class = "smallcaps">John
Chandos</span> bore his Banner (displayed) to his own Company, and
said&mdash;’Gentlemen, see here my Banner and yours;
<span class = "pagenum">249</span>
<a name = "page249" id = "page249"> </a>
preserve it as your own!’” We see that, like another hero of a later
period, the <span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span> held the
maxim&mdash;“England expects every man to do his duty.”</p>

<p>Quarterings, Marks of Cadency, and Differences (but not impalements)
are blazoned on Banners under the very same conditions that they appear
on Shields of Arms. For example, the Banners, as well as the Shield, on
the seal of Sir Robert de Hungerford, <a href = "#fig392">No. 392</a>,
are Differenced with a label for Cadency, and thus are distinguished
from the corresponding Banners and Shield on the Seal of Sir Robert’s
father, <a href = "#fig391">No. 391</a>.</p>

<p>Crests, Badges, Supporters, and other external accessories and
ornaments of Armorial Shields have no place on Banners, a&nbsp;Banner
representing a Shield, and being charged
<span class = "pagenum">250</span>
<a name = "page250" id = "page250"> </a>
as a Shield. In the seventeenth century, however, English Banners
sometimes were charged with Achievements of Arms, including all the
accessories and ornaments of Shields.</p>

<p>In early times Banners appear in use at sea, as well as on land; and
the same Banners were used both on shore and afloat. The <i>sails</i> of
our early shipping, also, are constantly represented as covered with
armorial blazonry, and they thus were enabled to act as Ship-Flags. Many
curious and interesting representations of the strange, unwieldy,
unship-shape looking craft that were the ancestors of the British Navy,
are introduced with their <i>heraldic sails</i> and their Banners into
the compositions of Seals. A&nbsp;fine example of its order is the Seal
of <span class = "smallcaps">John Holland</span>, Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Huntingdon</span>, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>
1436, “Admiral of England, Ireland, and Aquitaine,” No. 414. The ship is
really a noble-looking vessel, with her solitary sail blazoned with the
Lord Admiral’s Arms&mdash;<i>England, within a bordure of
France</i>,&mdash;the same arms that were borne by Prince <span class =
"smallcaps">John of Eltham</span>, <a href = "#fig24">No. 24</a>. In
this example the crew are not represented: but in other Seals of early
shipping figures are commonly introduced, and almost always they are
drawn of ludicrously disproportionate size. This ship does not display
any Banner from a banner-staff, but has a nautical Pennon of ample size
flying at the mast-head: when Banners are displayed on board ships upon
early Seals, they are generally narrow in proportion to their height,
a&nbsp;form of Banner adopted on land as well as at sea, in consequence
of the greater inconvenience attending the display of broad or really
square Banners. At a later period, however, Ship-Flags of very large
size came into favour.</p>

<p>3. The <span class = "smallcaps">Standard</span>, the third variety
of early heraldic Flags, which first appears about the middle of the
fourteenth century, and was in general use by personages of high rank in
the two following centuries, appears to have been adopted for the
special purpose of displaying the
<span class = "pagenum">251</span>
<a name = "page251" id = "page251"> </a>
Badge. The Badge was worn on his livery by a servant as retainer, and
consequently the Standard by which he mustered in camp was of the livery
colours, and bore the Badge, with both of which the retainer was
familiar.</p>

<p>This Flag is of ample proportions, and great length; but its size
varies with the owner’s rank. Next to the Staff was usually to be found
the <i>red cross on a silver field</i> of <span class = "smallcaps">St.
George</span>. The rest of the field is generally divided per fesse into
two tinctures, in most cases the livery colours of the owner, or the
prevailing tinctures of his Coat of Arms, which in such cases may almost
be assumed to have been his livery. With some principal figure or device
occupying a prominent position, various Badges are displayed over the
whole field, a&nbsp;Motto, which is placed bend-wise, having divided the
Standard into compartments. The edges are fringed throughout, and the
extremity is sometimes swallow-tailed, and sometimes rounded.</p>

Badges is introduced. The student will not fail to take notice of the
systematic display of the ensign of St. George in these Standards, as
the national armorial device of England. The use and heraldic display of
these standards had practically lapsed, but the College of Arms has now
reverted to its ancient practice of recording them in cases of the grant
or confirmation of a Badge.</p>

Standard is duly differenced with their own Marks of Cadency and their
Shields of Pretence for the different members of the Royal Family. For
use at sea, whilst the <span class = "smallcaps">Prince of Wales</span>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Union Jack</span>, which is regarded as
the national British Flag, as we now display it, is the second of its
race. Strictly speaking, it is as much the property of the Sovereign as
the Royal Banner, but objection to its use and display is not officially
made. The <i>First Union Jack</i>, No. 417, was produced
<span class = "pagenum">253</span>
<a name = "page253" id = "page253"> </a>
in obedience to a Royal Proclamation of <span class =
"smallcaps">James&nbsp;I.</span> in the year 1606. Its object was to
provide a single National Flag for both England and Scotland as a single
kingdom, which might put an end to certain serious disputes concerning
the precedence of their respective Banners of St. George and St. Andrew,
Nos. 418, 419, between the natives of England and Scotland&mdash;of
“South and North Britain.” This “Union” Flag combined the blazonry of
the two rival ensigns, not marshalling them by quartering after the
early heraldic usage, but by reviving a still earlier process, and by
blending the cross and the saltire of Nos. 418 and 419 in a single
composition. This was effected, accordingly, by charging the Cross of
St. George, with a narrow border or “fimbriation” of white to represent
its white field, <i>upon</i> the Banner of St. Andrew, the result being
the Flag shown in No. 417. On the final “Union” between England and
Scotland in 1707, this device was formally declared to be the “Ensign
armorial of the United Kingdom of Great Britain.”</p>

<p>Upon the first day of January, 1801, the <i>Second Union Jack</i>,
the “Union Jack” of to-day, No. 420, superseded the Flag of King <span
class = "smallcaps">James</span> and Queen <span class =
"smallcaps">Anne</span>. The “Union” with Ireland rendered a change
necessary in the Union Jack, in order to incorporate with its blazonry
the Banner of
<span class = "pagenum">254</span>
<a name = "page254" id = "page254"> </a>
<span class = "smallcaps">St. Patrick</span>, No. 421, <i>arg.,
a&nbsp;saltire gu.</i> There seems good reason to believe that the
so-called Cross of St. Patrick had little, if indeed any, separate or
prior existence. The process that had been adopted before was again
brought into action, but now a single compound device had to be formed
by the combination of a cross and two saltires, Nos. 418, 419, and 421.
As before, in this new Flag the blue field of <span class =
"smallcaps">St. Andrew</span> forms the field: then the two Saltires,
the one white and the other red, are formed into a single compound
Saltire counter-changed of the two tinctures alternating, the white
having precedence; a&nbsp;narrow edging of white is next added to each
red side of this new figure, to represent the white field of St.
Patrick, as the narrow edging of white about the red cross represented
the white field of <span class = "smallcaps">St. George</span> in No.
418; and, finally, the red cross of St. George fimbriated with white, as
in the First Jack, is charged over all. Such is the Second Union Jack,
No. 420. In this compound device it will be observed that the <i>broad
diagonal white</i> members represent the <i>silver saltire</i> of St.
Andrew, No. 419: that the <i>red diagonal</i> members represent the
<i>saltire gules</i> of St. Patrick, No. 421, and that the <i>narrow
diagonal white</i> lines are added in order to place this <i>saltire
gules on a field argent</i>: that the <i>diagonal red and
<span class = "pagenum">255</span>
<a name = "page255" id = "page255"> </a>
the broad diagonal white members</i> represent the two Saltires of St.
Andrew and St. Patrick in combination: and that the <i>fimbriated red
cross</i> in the front of the goodly alliance declares the presence of
the symbol of St. George.</p>

<p>Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Harris Nicholas</span> has suggested
that this flag may have acquired its name of “Jack” (“Union” is obvious
enough) from the original author of the First Union Flag, King <span
class = "smallcaps">James</span>, who, in the Heralds’ French language,
would be styled <i>Jacques</i>: and so the Flag would be called
“Jacques’ Union,” which would easily settle down into “Jack’s Union,”
and finally would as easily become “Union Jack.” The Second Union Flag
is always to be hoisted as it is represented in No. 420, the diagonal
white having precedence in the first canton. To reverse the proper
display of the Flag implies distress or danger; or such a procedure
(very often, as I am aware, unconsciously adopted, through ignorance of
the real meaning of the Flag itself) subjects the Union Jack to
degradation.</p>

<p>By a recent warrant Lords Lieutenant fly the Union Jack charged with
a sword fesseways.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Ensigns</span> now in use
are:&mdash;</p>

No. 422.&mdash; The Red Ensign.</p>
</div>

<p>1. The <i>Red Ensign</i>, a plain red Flag cantoning a Union
Jack&mdash;having a Jack in the dexter chief angle next to the point of
suspension: No. 422. This Ensign shares with the Union Jack the honour
of being the “Ensign of England”&mdash;the Ensign, that is, of the
British Empire. When displayed at sea, it now distinguishes all vessels
that do not belong to the Royal Navy: but, before the year 1864, it was
the distinguishing ensign of the “red squadron of the Navy,” and of the
“Admirals of the Red”&mdash;the Admirals of the highest rank.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">256</span>
<a name = "page256" id = "page256"> </a>
<p>2. The <i>White</i> or <i>St. George’s Ensign</i> is the old banner
of St. George, <a href = "#fig418">No. 418</a>, with a Jack cantoned in
the first quarter. It now is the Ensign of the Royal Navy: but, before
1864, it distinguished the “white squadron” of the Navy, and the
Admirals&mdash;second in rank&mdash;of that Squadron.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Blue Ensign</i> differs from the Red only in the field
being plain blue instead of red. It now is the Ensign of the Naval
Reserve: before 1864 it was the Ensign of “Admirals of the Blue,” third
in rank, and of their Squadron of the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>A Red Ensign is often charged with a Crown, or with some appropriate
device, to denote some particular department of the public service.</p>

<p>With the Ensigns may be grouped the <i>Flag of the Admiralty</i>,
which displays a yellow anchor and cable set fesse-wise on a red
field.</p>

<p>The Ensigns are always to be hoisted so as to have the Jack next to
the point of suspension, as in No. 422.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Military Flags.</span> 1. <i>Cavalry
Standards</i>, being lineal descendants of the knightly Banners of
mediæval chivalry, are small square Flags, the colour of the field the
same as the regimental facings; and each Standard bears the Number,
Motto, and specific Title of its own Regiment, with whatever heraldic
Badge or Device may be associated with it. Upon these Standards also are
blazoned the regimental “<i>Honours</i>”&mdash;such words as <span class
= "smallcaps">Waterloo</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Alma</span>,
<span class = "smallcaps">Lucknow</span>, and others, which briefly and
with most emphatic significance declare the services of the corps. The
Household Cavalry, the Life Guards and Blues, have all their Standards
of Crimson, and they are blazoned with the Royal Insignia and their own
“Honours” and Devices.</p>

<p>2. <i>Infantry Colours.</i> In the first instance, each Regiment of
Infantry had one “Colour”: subsequently, two others were added: and,
finally, in the reign of Queen Anne, it was decided that every Infantry
Regiment or
<span class = "pagenum">257</span>
<a name = "page257" id = "page257"> </a>
Battalion of the Line (the Rifles of the Line excepted, who have no
“Colours”) should have its own “Pair of Colours.” Of this “Pair,” one is
the “<i>King’s Colour</i>”&mdash;a Union Jack charged with some
regimental Devices: the other, the “<i>Regimental Colour</i>” is of the
tincture of the facings, on which the “Honours” and “Devices” of the
Regiment are charged, and in the dexter chief angle a small Jack is
cantoned: in fact, the “Regimental Colour” is the same as the Red or
Blue Ensign (<a href = "#fig422">No. 422</a>), the Colour of the field
varying with the regimental facings, and the field itself being charged
with the various Devices.</p>

<p>In their Colours, the Guards reverse the arrangement that obtains
with the Regiments of the Line. With them, the <i>Kings Colour</i> is
always crimson, with or without a Jack, but charged with the Royal
Cypher and the regimental Devices: the <i>Regimental Colour</i> of the
Guards is the Union Jack.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Royal Artillery</i> have no Colours or Standards.</p>

<p>Military Flags are not now used in actual warfare by British
troops.</p>

<p>I conclude this Chapter, which treats briefly of the Heraldry of the
most important English Flags, with four still more brief general
remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. First: by all English people who are disposed to exclaim, making
<span class = "smallcaps">Shakespeare’s</span> words their own,
“<i>Prosper our Colours!</i>” it ought to be understood that their
National Flags are endowed with heraldic, that is, with historical
significance, recorded after an heraldic fashion.</p>

<p>2. Second: this significance of their Flags ought also to be
understood, that it may be appreciated, by all true English people.</p>

<p>3. Third: our Flags ought always to be made and represented
correctly.</p>

<p>And 4. Lastly: our Flags, and all other Flags also, ought always to
be hoisted and displayed rightly and properly.</p>

<p>The Arms of <span class = "smallcaps">Hanover</span>, on the
accession of <span class = "smallcaps">George&nbsp;I.</span>,
August&nbsp;1, 1714, were added to the Shield of the United Kingdom.
This was accomplished by removing the charges (<i>England and Scotland
impaled</i>) from the fourth quarter of the Shield, No. 427, and
charging that quarter with the arms of <i>Hanover</i> as they appear on
the Shield, No. 428:&mdash;<i>Per pale and per chevron</i>,

<p>Till the time of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span>, the

of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>, <span class =

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span>, as shown by his

alternating with the leaves.</p>

<p>From the time of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;V.</span>, the
circlet has been heightened by <i>crosses pattées</i> and <i>fleurs de
lys</i> alternating, four of each, and without any leaves. <span class =

jewelled bands</i>, which at their intersection he surmounted with a

a similar <i>label</i>, charged with <i>three hearts</i> and <i>two

<p>The <i>label</i> of H.R.H. the first Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Cambridge</span> was silver, of three points, and the points
differenced with <i>a red cross</i> in the centre, and on each of the

<i>label</i> of three

points <i>gules</i>. The <i>label</i> of H.R.H. the first Duke of <span

"smallcaps">King George III.</span>) was of silver, and of <i>three
points</i> charged with a <i>fleur de lys</i> between <i>two crosses
gules</i>. The second Duke bore an additional <i>label</i> of <i>three
points gules</i>, the <i>centre point</i> charged with the <i>white
horse of Hanover</i>. These Dukes bore the Royal Arms as used in the
reign of <span class = "smallcaps">George&nbsp;III.</span> and not as
altered for Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Victoria</span>,
differencing the accessories as well as the Shield with their
<i>labels</i>.</p>

<p>In 1904 a warrant was issued for H.R.H. Prince <span class =
"smallcaps">Arthur of Connaught</span>. The label was of five points
charged with three red crosses and two blue fleurs de lys alternately.
The coronet assigned to him was of crosses patée and strawberry leaves
alternately.</p>

<p>An interesting warrant was issued for the Princess <span class =
"smallcaps">Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg</span>, now Queen of <span
class = "smallcaps">Spain</span>, in view of her then approaching
marriage. This assigned to her the arms of her father within a bordure
of England, and each of the supporters had a banner of the Royal Arms of
the United Kingdom placed in his paws.</p>

<p>Even more interesting was the warrant issued in 1913 to H.H. Princess
<span class = "smallcaps">Alexandra</span>, Duchess of <span class =
"smallcaps">Fife</span>. This assigned to her upon a lozenge the Royal
Arms, differenced by the same label as that of her mother the Princess
Royal, and upon an inescutcheon the quarterly coat of Duff, the
inescutcheon being surmounted by the coronet of a Duchess of the United
Kingdom, and the lozenge itself being surmounted by the coronet of a
Princess of the rank of Highness. The dexter supporter is the Royal Lion
of England crowned with the last-mentioned coronet and charged with the
label as in the arms. The sinister supporter is a savage taken from the
supporters of the late Duke of Fife.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "smallcaps">Knighthood</span>, as that term is generally
understood in its comprehensive acceptation, has been well defined to be
“a distinction of rank amongst freemen, depending not upon birth or
property, but simply upon the admission of the person so distinguished,
by the girding of a sword or other similar solemnity, into an order of
men having by law or usage certain social or political privileges,” and
also a certain appropriate title. It is evident, therefore, from this
definition that Knighthood implies the existence of these two
conditions: the one, that the man to be admitted to the rank of
Knighthood should possess such qualifications as may entitle him to that
distinction; and the other, that Knighthood should be conferred by a
personage endowed with a competent power and authority.</p>

<p>In feudal times the qualifications for Knighthood were military
exploits of a distinguished character, and eminent
<span class = "pagenum">274</span>
<a name = "page274" id = "page274"> </a>
services, of whatever kind, rendered to the King and the realm: also,
the holding a certain property in land (in the time of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;I.</span>, land then of the yearly value of £20,
or upwards), whether directly from the King, or under some Noble, by the
feudal tenure of personal military service to be rendered under certain
established conditions; but it has been disputed whether there was any
necessary connection between Knighthood, as such, and the Knight Service
of Feudal Tenure. During the first two centuries after the Conquest,
Knighthood was conferred by the great Barons and by the Spiritual Peers,
as well as by the King himself, or by his appointed representative: but,
after the accession of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;III.</span>,
the prevailing rule appears to have been that in England no persons
should be created Knights except by the King, or the Prince Royal acting
for his Father, or by the King’s General-in-Chief, or other personal
representative.</p>

<p>The knightly rank, as it gave an increase of dignity, implied also
the maintenance of a becoming state, and the discharge of certain civil
duties: and, more particularly, all Knights were required to make such a
provision for rendering military service as was held to be consistent
with their position and their property; and it was expected from them
that they should take a dignified part in the chivalrous exercises and
celebrations of their times. It followed, that feudal Knighthood was a
distinction which, if not conferred for the sake of honour, became
obligatory; and fines, accordingly, were imposed upon men qualified for
Knighthood who, notwithstanding, were found not to be Knights. In the
course of time, as the rigour of the feudal system abated, the numbers
of the military tenants of small tenures greatly increased: and, since
many of these persons had no inclination for the profession of arms,
they gladly accepted the alternative of paying a fine, which enabled
them to evade an honour unsuited as well to their means as to their
<span class = "pagenum">275</span>
<a name = "page275" id = "page275"> </a>
personal tastes and their peaceful avocations. A&nbsp;fruitful source of
revenue thus was secured for the Crown, while the military character of
Knighthood was maintained, and at the same time a new and important
class of the community gradually became established.</p>

<p>The Knights of Norman England, who at first were soldiers of the
highest order, derived their designation from their warlike predecessors
of Anglo-Saxon times, the word “<i>cniht</i>,” in the late Anglo-Saxon
tongue, signifying a military attendant. When they had established
themselves in the position and in the possession of the lands of the
Anglo-Saxons, the Anglo-Norman Knights retained their own original
title. The Latin equivalent for that title of “Knight” is
“<i>Miles</i>,” and the Norman-French is “<i>Chevalier</i>.”</p>

<p>These Knights may be grouped in two classes. The first class contains
all persons who had been admitted into the comprehensive Order of
Chivalry&mdash;who were Knights by reason of their common Knighthood.
The second class is formed of Knights who, in addition to their Knightly
rank, were members of some special and distinct Fraternity,
Companionship, or Order of Knighthood. Every Society of this kind has
always possessed Laws, Institutions, Titles, and Insignia peculiar to
itself.</p>

<p>The peculiar character and object of the Crusades led to the
formation of two Orders of <i>Priest-Knights</i>&mdash;Orders not
belonging to any particular nation, but numbering amongst their members
men of all nations. These are the Orders of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Knights of St. John of Jerusalem</span>, or <span class =
"smallcaps">Hospitallers</span>, and of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Knights Templars</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Hospitallers</span>, instituted about
<span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1092, were introduced into
England about 1100. In the year 1310 they were established at Rhodes,
and in 1530 at Malta, under their forty-third Grand Master, <span class
= "smallcaps">Philippe de Villiers de L’Isle-Adam</span>. Their device
is a <i>silver cross of eight
<span class = "pagenum">276</span>
<a name = "page276" id = "page276"> </a>
points</i>, <a href = "#fig107">No. 107</a>, charged upon a <i>black
field</i>, or worn upon a black surcoat or mantle. The Order was finally
suppressed in England in 1559.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Templars</span>, instituted about <span
class = "smallroman">A.D.</span> 1118, were introduced into England
about 1140. In the year 1309 they were suppressed, and in 1312 their
Order was finally abolished. They wore <i>a Cross</i> of the same form
as <a href = "#fig107">No. 107</a>, but of a <i>red colour upon a white
field</i>. This red cross they charged upon a white banner: and they
bore another banner, <a href = "#fig13">No. 13</a>, of <i>black and
white</i>, entitled “<i>Beau Seant</i>.” The same words, “<i>Beau
Seant!</i>” were their war-cry. The Badges of the Templars were the
<i>Agnus Dei</i>&mdash;the Holy Lamb, holding a red-cross banner; and a
device representing two Knights mounted on a single horse, intended to
denote the original poverty of the Order.<a class = "tag" name = "tag8"

No. 433.&mdash; Insignia of the Order of the Garter.</p>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Order of the Garter</span>, a military
Fraternity under the special patronage of “<span class = "smallcaps">St.
George</span>, the good Knight,” was instituted at Windsor by King <span
class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> in, or about, the year
1350&mdash;very probably in the summer of 1348, but the exact time is
not positively known. It may safely be assumed, that the occasion which
led to the institution of this most noble and renowned Order, was a
Tournament or Hastilude of unusual importance held at his Castle of
Windsor by <span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> at the most
brilliant period of his reign: and it is highly probable that the Order
suggested itself to the mind of the King, as a natural result of his own
chivalrous revival of a knightly “Round Table,” such as flourished in
the days of King Arthur. How much of historical fact there may be in the
popular legend, which professes to derive from a certain romantic
incident the
<span class = "pagenum">277</span>
<a name = "page277" id = "page277"> </a>
Title certainly borne by King <span class = "smallcaps">Edward’s</span>
Order from the time of its original institution, it is not possible to
determine: but the legend itself is not in any way inconsistent with the
spirit of those times; nor would the Knights Founders of the Garter
regard their Order as the less honourable, because its Title might
remind them of the happy gallantry, with which the casual misadventure
of a noble Lady had been turned to so good an account by a most princely
Monarch. The Statutes of the Order have been continually modified and
altered, and the original military character of the Institution has long
ceased to exist: still, no changes in the Order of the Garter have
affected the pre-eminence of its dignity and reputation. Illustrious now
as ever, and foremost in rank and honour in
<span class = "pagenum">278</span>
<a name = "page278" id = "page278"> </a>
our own country, the <span class = "smallcaps">Garter</span> is second
to no knightly Order in the world.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Most Noble Order of the Garter</span>
consists of the <span class = "smallcaps">Sovereign</span> and
Twenty-five <span class = "smallcaps">Knights Companions</span>, of whom
the <span class = "smallcaps">Prince of Wales</span> always is one. By a
Statute of the year 1805, the Order includes such lineal descendants of
<span class = "smallcaps">George&nbsp;III.</span> as may be elected: and
still more recent statutes have provided for the admission of foreign
Sovereigns, and also of certain “Extra Knights,” who are elected
“Companions” as vacancies occur.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Officers</span> of the Order
are&mdash;The <i>Prelate</i>, the Bishop of Winchester: the
<i>Chancellor</i>, the Bishop of Oxford: the <i>Registrar</i>, the Dean
of Windsor: the <i>Herald</i>, Garter King of Arms: and, the <i>Usher of
the Black Rod</i>.</p>

<p>Knights of the Garter place the initials “K.G.” after their names;
and these letters take precedence of all other titles, those of Royalty
alone excepted.</p>

<p>The Stalls of the Knights are in the choir of St. George’s Chapel,
Windsor Castle, where their Garter-plates are fixed, and their Banners
are displayed.</p>

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Insignia</span> of the Order of the
Garter are&mdash;The <i>Garter</i> itself, of a light blue originally,
now of a dark blue, with border, buckle, and pendant of gold. On it, in
golden letters, the <i>Motto</i>&mdash;HONI . SOIT . QVI . MAL . Y .
PENSE&mdash;“Dishonour to him who thinks ill of it;” and not, as it is
commonly rendered, “Evil to him that evil thinks.”</p>

<p>The Badge of the Order is circular, and formed of a buckled Garter
enclosing a Shield of St. George, the whole blazoned in the proper
tinctures: it is worn on the left shoulder of the blue velvet Mantle.
When irradiated with eight rays of silver or diamonds, a&nbsp;device
resembling the Badge in every respect, except that the cross of St.
George is enclosed within the Garter without being charged on a Shield,
forms the <i>Star</i> of the Order.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">279</span>
<a name = "page279" id = "page279"> </a>
<p>The <i>Collar</i>, of gold enamelled, is formed of twelve buckled
Garters, each encircling a Tudor Rose, and as many knots of intertwined
cords. Attached to this Collar is the <i>George</i>&mdash;a mounted
figure of the Saint in the act of trampling down the dragon and piercing
him with his lance. The Collar and George were added to the Insignia by

The Lesser George,<br>

</div>

<p>The <i>Lesser George</i>, or <i>Jewel</i>, added by <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VIII.</span>, has the same device placed on an
enamelled field, and forming a jewel generally oval in form; it is
encircled by a buckled Garter of the Order, and represented in No. 434.
It was this Lesser George that <span class =
"smallcaps">Charles&nbsp;I.</span>, immediately before he suffered,
delivered to Archbishop <span class = "smallcaps">Juxon</span>, with the
word, “Remember.” As a matter of course, the figure of <span class =
"smallcaps">St. George</span> ought always to be represented as a
Knight, armed and equipped as one of the Christian chivalry of the
Middle Ages&mdash;not as a pagan horseman of antiquity, and more
particularly not in the guise of such a nude champion as appears on some
of our modern coins. The Lesser George, often incorrectly called the
Badge, at first was sometimes worn from a gold chain, and sometimes from
a <i>black Ribbon</i>. The Colour of the ribbon was changed to <i>sky
blue</i> by Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Elizabeth</span>; and it has
since been again changed to the <i>dark blue</i> of the broad Ribbon now
worn. This <i>Ribbon</i> of the Order crosses the figure of the wearer,
passing over the left shoulder, and the Lesser George hangs from it
under the right arm.</p>

<p>Since the time of <span class = "smallcaps">Charles&nbsp;II.</span>
it has been customary

<p>The <span class = "smallcaps">Order of the Thistle, of
Scotland</span>, styled “Most Noble and Most Ancient,” and indicated by
the Initials “K.T.,” was originally instituted long before the accession
of a Scottish Sovereign to the Crown of England; but it is now governed
by statutes framed by <span class = "smallcaps">James&nbsp;II.</span> of
Great Britain, <span class = "smallcaps">Anne</span>, and <span class =
"smallcaps">George&nbsp;IV.</span></p>

<p>The Order consists of the SOVEREIGN and sixteen <span class =

a figure of St. Andrew standing upon a mount holding his silver Saltire
and surrounded by rays in the form of a glory. This Badge is worn from
the <i>Collar</i> of the Order, formed of sixteen Thistles alternating
with as many bunches of rue-sprigs; or, from a broad <i>dark green
Ribbon</i>, which crosses the left shoulder. There are fine examples of
these Insignia sculptured upon the Monument of <span class =

is shown in <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Fig.’">No.</ins> 435.</p>

<p>The <i>Star</i> of this Order, of silver or diamonds, is in the form
of a St. Andrew’s Saltire, having its four limbs alternating with the
four points of a lozenge: in the centre, surrounded by the Motto (NEMO

<p>The Most Honourable <span class = "smallcaps">Order of the
Bath</span> is an early Institution which, after having long been in
abeyance, has been revived and remodelled, and has received fresh
statutes in the years 1725, 1815, 1847, and 1859.</p>

<p>The Order, now numbering about a thousand members, consists of
several distinct Groups or Classes, which include, with the SOVEREIGN,
the Royal Princes, and some few distinguished Foreigners, Officers of
our own Navy and Army, and also Diplomatic and Civil Servants of the
Crown.</p>

<p>The Three “Classes” of the Order alike include members of the Three
Services, and each class is divided into two divisions, viz. Military
and Civil.</p>

<p>The “First Class,” of <span class = "smallcaps">Knights Grand Cross

North Britain. Before the time of the peace-loving son of Mary Stuart,
a&nbsp;Sovereign of another mould, <span class =

and establishing some definite system of Precedence amongst the various
degrees, orders, and ranks of his subjects: and, in 1539, a&nbsp;statute
to that effect was enacted. Other statutes afterwards were added; and,
from time to time, Royal Letters Patent on the same subject have been
issued; and thus the Precedence now recognised and in use amongst us has
been established.</p>

<p>By Marriage Women share the Dignities and Precedence of their
Husbands: but, the strictly Official Dignity of a Husband is not
imparted to a wife (except in India), in the case of the Archbishops and
Bishops or holders of other offices.</p>

<p>The Dignities which Ladies have by Birth or by right of Inheritance,
are not imparted by Marriage to their Husbands: nor does Marriage with
an inferior in Dignity in any way affect the Precedence that a Lady may
enjoy by Birth, Inheritance, or Creation&mdash;both her own Precedence
and that of her Husband remain as before their Marriage, unless the
Husband be a Peer.</p>

<p>In the <span class = "smallcaps">Royal Family</span> the following
Precedence takes effect:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "hanging close">
<p>The Queen.</p>
<p>The Queen Dowager.</p>
<p>The Princess of Wales.</p>
<p>The Daughters of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>Wives of the Sovereign’s Nephews (Brothers’ and Sisters’
Daughters).</p>
<p>Granddaughters of the Sovereign not bearing the style of Royal
Highness.</p>
</div>

<p>To whatever Precedence she may be entitled by Birth, the Wife of a
Peer always takes her rank, and therefore takes her actual Precedence,
from her Husband.</p>

<p>The Widow of a Peer, so long as she remains a Widow, retains the rank
she enjoyed whilst married: but, should she contract a second Marriage,
her Precedence then is determined either by the rank of her second
Husband, or by the rank that was her own by Birth and which she enjoyed
before her first Marriage.</p>

<p>The Wife of the Eldest Son of any degree precedes all her Husband’s
Sisters, and also all other Ladies having the same degree of rank with
them. Thus:&mdash;the Wife of the
<span class = "pagenum">300</span>
<a name = "page300" id = "page300"> </a>
Eldest Son of an Earl takes Precedence of <i>all</i> Daughters of Earls.
In actual practice, however, by a principle of Precedence that is
accepted and adopted in all families of the same degree amongst
themselves, the Sisters in every case have their place immediately after
the Wife of their own Eldest Brother.</p>


<h6>GENEALOGIES.</h6>

<p><span class = "smallcaps">Genealogies</span>, the Records of the
Descents and Alliances of Families, are necessarily associated with the
Armorial Ensigns borne by those Families, and by the several Members and
Branches of them. Still, it does not apparently follow, in the same
manner, as a matter of necessity, that the study and investigation of
Genealogies should be interesting and even attractive, because interest
and attractiveness are inseparable from Heraldry. And yet, I&nbsp;do not
hesitate to claim for genealogical researches the favourable regard of
students of Armory, on the very ground of the interest which they are
certain to feel in such researches; and also in confident reliance on
that inherent power of attraction, inseparable from the subject itself,
that will not fail both to win their favourable regard, and to lead them
on from one inquiry to another.</p>

<p>The very act of tracing up some eminent and illustrious personage,
from generation to generation of his forefathers, noting down the
alliances that have interwoven one thread of a brilliant line with
others not less lustrous; or, the reverse of this process, the following
the lineage of some worthy of the olden time onward down the stream,
observing both the tributaries that flow into the main channel and the
streamlets that issue from it&mdash;all this, when once it has been
systematically undertaken, leads the student through the most
picturesque regions of historical romance.</p>

<p>The popular idea of Genealogy may be, that it consists
<span class = "pagenum">301</span>
<a name = "page301" id = "page301"> </a>
in placing in a formal order of arrangement a series of dry names,
connected with dates that (if it be possible) are even more dry. It is
not uncommon to dispose of many things precisely in the same way, when
an opinion is formed without even the slightest attempt to judge of a
question by its true merits&mdash;it is so easy to decline the trouble
and to avoid the effort attendant on inquiry and investigation, and so
pleasant to become the possessor of an “opinion” and “views,” without
any outlay in acquiring them. A&nbsp;Map has no value in the estimation
of those who ignore Geography: the claims of Archæology are disregarded
by all who are content to remain in ignorance even of what it implies:
and History itself becomes and continues to be a dead letter, so long as
an acquaintance is formed only with the exterior of its volumes. And, in
like manner, Genealogy appears under a very different aspect to those
who know it only by name, and to lovers of Biography and History who are
familiar with its lucid and yet ever suggestive guidance. Without
written Genealogies, who can clearly understand the political and
historical position of the rival Princes of the red and white Roses; or
of <span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VII.</span> and the “last of the
Plantagenets”; or of Queens <span class = "smallcaps">Elizabeth
Tudor</span>, <span class = "smallcaps">Mary Stuart</span>, and <span
class = "smallcaps">Jane Grey</span>? Or who, without similar aid, will
follow out the fortunes of the Houses of B<span class =
"smallcaps">eauchamp</span> and <span class = "smallcaps">Neville</span>
and <span class = "smallcaps">Dudley</span>, and connect them with the
existing noble lord of Warwick Castle; or, when reading of the <span
class = "smallcaps">De Clares</span>, the <span class =
"smallcaps">Bohuns</span>, or the <span class =
"smallcaps">Percies</span>, will see at a glance the connection between
“<span class = "smallcaps">Strongbow</span>” and the “red Earl <span
class = "smallcaps">Gilbert</span>,” or will understand the significance
of the white swan Badge of the <span class =
"smallcaps">Staffords</span>, or will read at sight the quartered Shield
of the Duke of <span class = "smallcaps">Northumberland</span>, of
to-day, and will discern the line that connects the living Earl <span
class = "smallcaps">Percy</span> with the “<span class =
"smallcaps">Hotspur</span>” whose fame was two centuries old when <span
class = "smallcaps">Shakespeare</span> wrote of him? And further, who,
that is
<span class = "pagenum">302</span>
<a name = "page302" id = "page302"> </a>
unable to accomplish such things as these, can appreciate History, can
enjoy it and apply its lessons aright?</p>

<p>In arranging a Genealogy the utmost conciseness is essential, all
details being left for full description elsewhere. All the members of
the same family are placed side by side, on the same level, in their
order of seniority; and all are connected by lines with one another and
with their parents. Successive generations also, throughout all the
branches of any family, or in allied families, have their places on the
same levels; and the connecting and distinguishing lines are continued
throughout. Examples of Genealogies treated in the most scientific and
yet simple manner, easy to be understood, and perfect as models for
students, may be obtained in any Part of the <i>Herald and
Genealogist</i>, formerly edited by the late Mr. <span class =
"smallcaps">J.&nbsp;G. Nichols</span>, F.S.A., Parliament Street,
Westminster. I&nbsp;refer to this excellent Periodical, because it is
not possible for me here in the space at my disposal to set forth a
really useful example of a Genealogy: and, I&nbsp;must add, because it
is most desirable that students of Heraldry should form such an
acquaintance with Mr. Nichols, as may be acquired through his works.
<i>Miscellanea Genealogica et Heraldica</i>, now edited by Mr. <span
class = "smallcaps">W.&nbsp;B. Bannerman</span>, is another Periodical,
which ought to be in the hands of all Genealogists.</p>

<p>In Genealogies, this mark == denotes alliance by marriage, and it is
placed between the names of a husband and wife: and the lines that
proceed from this mark, thus,<br>
<img src = "images/diagram.gif" width = "139" height = "27"
alt = "shape of family tree"></p>

<p>point out their issue. The initials S.&nbsp;P. (of the Latin words
<i>Sine Prole</i>, “without issue”) show where a line or a branch
ceases. Other abbreviations and signs in general use will suggest their
own signification.</p>

<p>As I began this Chapter with quotations, so with a quotation I
conclude it. “There are some persons,” writes Mr. <span class =
"smallcaps">Lower</span>, in his “Curiosities of Heraldry” (p. 292),
“who
<span class = "pagenum">303</span>
<a name = "page303" id = "page303"> </a>
cannot discriminate between the taste for pedigree” (or genealogy) “and
the pride of ancestry. Now these two feelings, though they often combine
in one individual, have no necessary connection with each other. Man is
said to be a hunting animal. Some hunt foxes; others for fame or
fortune. Others hunt in the intellectual field; some for the arcana of
Nature and of mind; some for the roots of words, or the origin of
things. I&nbsp;am fond of hunting out a pedigree.” And, gentle reader,
when you have joined the chase genealogical, I&nbsp;promise you, so also
will you&nbsp;be.</p>

rank, were incorporated as a Fraternity by <span class =
"smallcaps">Richard&nbsp;III.</span>, a&nbsp;Prince whose historical
reputation is by no means in harmony with that early act of his reign,
which has done such good service to English History&mdash;the Foundation
and Establishment of the <span class = "smallcaps">College of
Arms</span>, or, as it is commonly called, the <span class =
"smallcaps">Heralds’ College</span>.</p>

<p>The Letters Patent, issued for this purpose by<span class =
"smallcaps"> Richard III.</span>, bear date March the 2nd, 1483, the
first year of his reign. Very important privileges and immunities, with
high powers and authority, were granted to the incorporated Heralds: and
the “right fair and stately house,” called “Pulteney’s Inn,” situate in
the metropolitan parish of All Saints, was assigned to them as their
permanent official residence. The Charter granted to the Heralds by the
last Plantagenet Sovereign was confirmed by his successors.</p>

<p>The buildings of the College were destroyed by the great fire of
1666; but all the records and documents fortunately escaped, having been
removed to Whitehall;
<span class = "pagenum">305</span>
<a name = "page305" id = "page305"> </a>
and the edifice was subsequently rebuilt, chiefly at the cost of the
Heralds themselves, where it now stands between St. Paul’s Cathedral and
the Thames. There, in the College of Arms, are still carefully preserved
all that the early Heralds recorded and transmitted to our times. There,
not the least valuable of the contents of the College, an unique Library
is in the keeping of Guardians, who understand its true uses, as they
appreciate its preciousness. And there also the Headquarters of English
Heraldry are as duly established, as those of the British Army are at
the Horse Guards in Whitehall.</p>

<p>The great change that has come upon London since the Heralds rebuilt
their official home, has already caused some structural alteration in
the building, and has resulted in the College of Arms now appearing out
of place in its original position in the City. Other changes, which
follow in such rapid succession in that busy neighbourhood, render it by
no means improbable that the site of their College may be required for
some great “City improvement”; and so the Heralds may be constrained to
establish themselves in the more congenial regions of the metropolitan
“far west.” This, as I am disposed to consider, is one of those
consummations that are devoutly to be desired.</p>

<p>The times have been in which Heraldry could not number amongst its
true friends the official Heralds of the College of Arms: but, happily,
a&nbsp;very different, and in many most important respects a thoroughly
satisfactory condition of things now obtains at the College. So far as
the Heralds are concerned, as a body of learned, accomplished, and
courteous gentlemen, Heraldry now is admirably represented amongst us,
and faithfully supported. What still is deficient in the existing
constitution of the College of Arms, as a National Institution, is
adaptation to existing circumstances, sentiments, and requirements. It
is but a truism to assert that, as a National Institution, the
<span class = "pagenum">306</span>
<a name = "page306" id = "page306"> </a>
College of Arms does not fill its proper position: and, to all who are
familiar with the facts of the case, it is equally obvious that this is
simply because the College does not vindicate its indisputable title to
that position which really is its own.</p>

<p>Heraldry is decidedly popular. This popularity also is assuming a
more practical, and at the same time a more enduring form, through
gradually becoming the result of a correct appreciation of the true
character of Heraldry, and of its intrinsic value. At a time in which
people are beginning to feel and to admit that they <i>ought to know</i>
something about Heraldry, the College of Arms <i>ought to take the
lead</i> in making Heraldry still better understood, still more justly
appreciated, still more popular. The time, also, is indeed come in which
it is the bounden duty of the College of Arms to impress upon the
community at large, that <i>the sole source and fountain-head of
authority in all matters armorial, under the Sovereign, centres in
itself</i>. This is to be accomplished by the same process, and only by
the same process, by which the College of Arms may win for itself
thorough popularity and universal confidence. If the College requires
fresh or increased powers, application to that effect should be made to
the Legislature. The Heraldry of Scotland has been dealt with by
Parliament: and it would be equally easy to obtain such a statute as
would enable English Heraldry to do justice to itself, while fulfilling
its own proper duties.</p>

<p>Without abating or compromising in the slightest degree its own
dignity or the dignity of Heraldry, the College of Arms requires to be
transmuted from an exclusive into a popular Institution. It requires,
not indeed to have its object and aim and system of action changed, but
to have them expanded, and expanded so widely as to comprehend all the
heraldic requirements of the age. This is a subject of too urgent
importance not to be noticed here; but still,
<span class = "pagenum">307</span>
<a name = "page307" id = "page307"> </a>
it is not possible to do more than to notice it in very general
terms.</p>

<p>Upon one specific point, however, a few plain words may be spoken
without hesitation, and may be left by themselves without comment. The
Fees and Charges of all kinds for granting, matriculating, confirming,
and recording the rightful possession of armorial Insignia must be
arranged upon a perfectly fresh system, with such provisions and
modifications as may adapt them to every variety of circumstance and of
requirement. This is a question which can be regarded only from one
point of view by every true lover of Heraldry, and consequently by every
true friend of the College of Arms.</p>

<p>II. The National Heraldic body in Scotland, entitled the <span class
= "smallcaps">Lyon Office</span>, is under the presidency of the <i>Lyon
King of Arms</i>. The Chief of the Scottish official Heralds from May
1796 to a recent period had been a Peer of that realm; and the duties of
the office, accordingly, had been discharged for seventy years by a
<i>Lyon Depute</i>. But, on the death of the Earl of <span class =
"smallcaps">Kinnoul</span>, in February 1866, it was determined to
remodel in some respects the arrangements of the Lyon Office; and Mr.
<span class = "smallcaps">George Burnett</span>, who had long been “Lyon
Depute,” was appointed by Her Majesty to be “Lyon King.” He has been
succeeded by Sir <span class = "smallcaps">J. Balfour Paul</span>. The
Arms of the Lyon Office I have already given, No. <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘265’ corrected by hand">266</ins>.</p>

<p>The action of the Scottish Lyon King of Arms, and of the Institution
over which he presides, after having degenerated from the worthy
standard of earlier days, has revived under far happier conditions, and
with prospects that are eminently gratifying. It may be fairly expected,
indeed, that the most salutary results will be produced by the very
decided “tendency” that for some time has existed, “to cultivate the
rules and principles of that earlier age, to which”&mdash;writes Mr.
Seton&mdash;“we are indebted for a
<span class = "pagenum">308</span>
<a name = "page308" id = "page308"> </a>
system of Scottish Heraldry, whose purity certainly has not been
surpassed in any other corner of Christendom.” These words occur in a
highly interesting memoir of the Lyon Office, in the fourth chapter of
the work entitled “The Law and Practice of Heraldry in Scotland,” an
able and admirable volume, published in 1863 in Edinburgh, which shows
the growing popularity of a true Heraldry north of the Tweed, and proves
that in the author, Mr. Seton, Scottish Heraldry possesses an advocate
no less powerful than zealous and judicious.</p>

<p>III. Arms and Armorial Insignia are granted <i>only</i> through the
College of Arms in England, and through the Lyon Office in Scotland, in
both realms with the direct sanction of the Crown expressed in England
by the Earl Marshal. In Ireland all Grants are made by Ulster King of
Arms with the same sanction.</p>

<p>It is to be observed and kept in remembrance that the <i>sole
right</i> to Arms is a Grant from the College or the Crown, or
Inheritance by lineal descent from an ancestor to whom a Grant was made
or in whom a right to bear Arms has been officially recognised and
registered by the Crown.</p>

<p>All “Grants” and “Confirmations of Arms” (Confirmations, that is, of
the Claims of certain individuals to bear certain Arms, by some
uncertain right and title duly set forth and approved and thereafter
legalised by the Crown) are formally and regularly recorded, with a full
blazon of the insignia, at the College or Offices of Arms.</p>

<p>It is very greatly to be desired that, in addition to this
time-honoured usage of the Heralds in making these records, some simple
plan could be adopted for the periodical registration at the College of
Arms of all armorial insignia that are borne by right. Almost equally
desirable, also, it would be to make a corresponding registration, as
far as might be possible, of whatever insignia are borne <i>without</i>
any right. The contents of both registers would
<span class = "pagenum">309</span>
<a name = "page309" id = "page309"> </a>
form unquestionably useful publications of a periodical character. In
connection with any such project as I have just suggested, it appears to
me that good service might be rendered to the cause of true Heraldry
amongst us, if <i>Badges and Mottoes</i> (without any other insignia
whatever) were formally granted by the College, under certain
conditions, and at the cost of a small Fee.<a class = "tag" name =
"tag9" id = "tag9" href = "#note9">9</a></p>

<p>In new Grants of Arms, as in so many formal documents, something of
the early form of Expression, with some traces of its piquant
quaintness, are still retained. Very quaint indeed, and very extravagant
also, is the style that was generally adopted by the Heralds of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and yet characteristic of both the
men and their times. As an example of one of these old documents, an
example of no common interest in itself, I&nbsp;now give the Grant of
Arms to <span class = "smallcaps">John Shakespere</span>, the Poet’s
father, in the year 1596. Two draft copies of the original Grant are
preserved in the College of Arms; the following transcript is printed
from the later of the two copies, the earlier having been used to supply
any word or passage that now is wanting in the other. The insertions
thus obtained are printed in brackets.</p>

<p>Like other documents of its class, in this Grant the language is
framed after certain regular forms; so that it is to be read without
that exact observance of particular expressions, which is rightly
bestowed upon legal and historical records. The interest inseparable
from this Grant is enhanced in no slight degree by the strong
probability that John Shakespere made his application to the College of
Arms by the advice and in consequence of the request of his son. Had the
worthy Garter been able to divine the “dignities and desertes” of the
son, he might possibly have employed formal language of a still more
complimentary character, when drawing up a Grant of Arms for the
father.</p>

<p>I presume that an argument in support of the abolition of all
Taxation of “Armorial Bearings,” on the plea of the utter absurdity of a
tax upon an honourable distinction, would be met with the reply that
“Armorial Bearings” are taxed purely as “luxuries,” and without the
slightest reference to their intrinsic character. If the validity of
this plea must be admitted, still this tax might be levied with what may
be styled a becoming heraldic discrimination.</p>

<p>For example:&mdash;Arms distinguished by “Augmentations of Honour”
might be altogether exempted; a&nbsp;higher rate might be fixed in the
case of Arms that are ensigned with Coronets, and that display
Supporters. Arms borne by unquestionable right, and which are duly
recorded at the College, might be rated at a comparatively low charge,
certainly not to exceed five shillings a year. On the other hand, all
Arms or armorial insignia borne with a very questionable right, or
without even the pretence of any right whatever, might be subjected to
the ordinary tax for “Armorial Bearings” of their class multiplied
(according to circumstances) by four, six, or ten.</p>

<p>The tax estimated by the aid of the multiplication-table, that has
just been suggested, would extend, under a special schedule possessing a
high multiplying power, to any self-constituted “Establishment” or
“Office,” which, powerless to “grant” Arms, undertakes&mdash;in
consideration of a very trifling fee&mdash;to “find,” and either to
“sketch” or to “colour” them. Exceedingly simple is the process, by
means of which this undertaking is accomplished. It consists in
consulting a printed Armory; and, when the desired “Arms” have been
“found” in its well-stored columns, they then at once are assigned to
the applicant, in conformity with the comprehensive and beautifully
simple theory, that all persons having the same surname and who also
live (or were born) in the same county are equally
<span class = "pagenum">314</span>
<a name = "page314" id = "page314"> </a>
entitled to bear the same Arms. Probably it does not occur to the
patrons of advertising Heraldry-dealers, that upon precisely the same
principle every person who has the same “name and county” with any
officer who may be “found” in the Navy or the Army List, might assert a
right to whatever rank and title such an officer may enjoy by virtue of
his commission.</p>

<p>The almost universal desire to possess some kind of armorial
insignia, implies a corresponding recognition of the necessity to obtain
them from some Institution or Personage, supposed to be competent and
authorised both to determine what they should be, and to impart a right
to accept and to assume and bear them. It rests with the Heralds of the
College of Arms to take the initiative in a course of action, which
would direct all aspirants for heraldic distinctions, as a matter of
course, to their own doors. The Heralds, who really are Heralds, and who
alone are real Heralds, may rely on the support of Public Opinion. If a
fictitious Heraldry is not only prevalent, but in some sense actually in
the ascendant, it is not because the counterfeit is preferred to the
genuine, but because it is unconsciously mistaken for it. In very many
instances, indeed, a&nbsp;determination to obtain “Arms” is coupled with
an ignorance of Heraldry so complete, as to ignore the existence of any
such thing as a Heraldry that is fictitious.</p>

<p>A popular College of Arms, without any serious difficulty, might
establish its own authority with all classes of the community; and, at
the same time, it would not fail to impress upon the public mind the
very decided difference that exists between the heraldic and the
non-heraldic acceptation of the expression&mdash;“<i>an escutcheon of
pretence</i>.” Much real good would certainly result from the rude shock
that would be given to many a complacent display of armorial insignia,
by showing the proud blazonry
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
<a name = "page315" id = "page315"> </a>
to be <i>abated</i> with the baton sinister of heraldic untruth and
unwarrantable assumption. And better still it would be to show to all
who possess, or who desire to possess and to bear “Arms,” that the
“Pride of Heraldry” is a worthy and a noble pride, because it is the
Pride of Truth and Right.</p>

of Arms of successive Sovereigns, exemplifies the changes that have
taken place in the form and adornment of the Crown, and it also is rich
in various Badges and Devices having an historical significance.</p>

<p>In Coins the Royal Shield is sometimes quartered by a cross charged
upon it, as in the silver penny of <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;VI.</span> A mediæval ship, having a sail
covered with heraldic blazonry, appears on the <i>Noble</i>&mdash;a coin
worthy of its name. A&nbsp;figure of the King in armour (not
particularly well proportioned to the size of the vessel), his sword in
one hand, and his Shield of arms in the other, is also represented in
these fine examples of mediæval numismatic art. A&nbsp;ship without any
sail, but in its stead charged with the Royal Shield heightened by a
Cross, forms the reverse of another excellent coin, the <i>Angel</i>,
the obverse bearing a figure of <span class = "smallcaps">St.
Michael</span> with his lance thrusting down the dragon. The Angel of
<span class = "smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;IV.</span> on either side of the
Cross has the initial E and the white rose of York; and the legend
is&mdash;PER : CRVCEM : TVA : SALVA : NOS : XTE : REDEMPT : (“By thy
Cross save us, O&nbsp;Redeemer
<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
<a name = "page317" id = "page317"> </a>
Christ!”). A&nbsp;Crowned Rose, with a Royal Cypher, is another
favourite device; as in the Shilling of Henry VIII., with the
legend&mdash;POSVI : DEV : ADIVTOREM : MEVM : (“I have placed God
(before me as) my helper”).</p>

<p>Such are a few examples of the early Heraldry of English Coins. More
recently, and particularly in our own Coinage, Heraldry and Art have
declined together, so that feeble designs, but too commonly executed
with lamentable consistency, are associated with heraldic inaccuracies
which continue uncorrected to this day&mdash;witness the <i>tressure of
Scotland</i> often incorrectly blazoned on the Royal Shield; and poor
<span class = "smallcaps">Britannia</span>, in her old position, sitting
forlorn on the copper and bronze coinage, as if conscious of being
constrained to display on her oval Shield an obsolete blazonry, that
placed the reign of Queen <span class = "smallcaps">Victoria</span> in
the eighteenth century!<a class = "tag" name = "tag12" id = "tag12" href

<p>II. To what has been already said on the value of heraldic <span
class = "smallcaps">Seals</span> I desire here to add a few words, in
the hope of inducing all students of Heraldry to study them with the
most diligent care.</p>

<p>Casts of fine impressions are not difficult to obtain. Almost every
accessible fine Seal has been copied by Mr. Ready, of the British
Museum, who supplies admirable casts at a very moderate cost. The
Scottish Seals of the late Mr. H. Laing, of Edinburgh, were purchased on
his decease by the authorities of the British Museum. The most
satisfactory casts are made in gutta-percha, which may be gilt by simply
rubbing a gold powder with a soft brush upon them, after slightly
warming their surfaces. Moulds for reproducing casts or impressions may
be made in gutta-percha; and from
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
<a name = "page318" id = "page318"> </a>
these moulds casts, also in gutta-percha, may be obtained. The process
is very simple: the gutta-percha, softened by immersion in hot water, is
pressed upon an impression in relief, until a perfect intaglio is
formed. When this mould is cold and hard, it will stamp an impression
upon gutta-percha softened in the same manner.</p>

<p>The liberality and kindness of Mr. Laing enable me to associate with
the Seal of Lord <span class = "smallcaps">Bardolf</span> a small group
of additional examples of Scottish Seals: two of them are good
illustrations as well of English as of Scottish Heraldry, and they
exemplify the usage of introducing Gothic traceries into the composition
of Seals with Shields of Arms: in both these examples, however, the
leading outlines only of the traceries remain, and the rich cusping
<span class = "pagenum">319</span>
<a name = "page319" id = "page319"> </a>
(which is so perfect in the Seal of Lord <span class =

1397, has a Shield bearing&mdash;<i>Arg., on a fesse az. three mullets

Shield <i>couchée</i> charged with <i>Az., a&nbsp;chevron between three

Crest, on a helm, is a bird, probably a popinjay or parrot. The Seal of
<span class = "smallcaps">Richard Stuart</span>, No. 445, probably about
1350, may be compared with <a href = "#fig414">No. 414</a>, p. 249: in
the smaller and earlier example, the solitary individual who represents
the crew may be assumed to be Richard Stuart himself; his vessel
displays two banners which are evidently affected by contrary currents
of air, and a pennon.</p>

<p>The noble Seal, <a href = "#fig446">No. 446</a> (<i>see</i>
Frontispiece), engraved from a most perfect impression recently
discovered appended to a document in the guardianship of the Dean and
Chapter of Westminster, represents its illustrious owner, <span class =

with the armorial insignia of Beauchamp (<i>gu., a&nbsp;fesse between

the bardings of the charger upon which the Earl is mounted. The
engraving of the Seal itself appears on the Frontispiece to this Volume:
and the Counter-Seal, one of the most beautiful and most perfect
examples in existence of the early seal-engraver’s art, is here
represented in No. 447. The Shield displayed on this Counter-Seal is
charged only with the Arms of the <span class =

House of
<span class = "pagenum">321</span>
<a name = "page321" id = "page321"> </a>
Beauchamp. The inscription is commenced on the Seal, <a href =
"#fig446">No. 446</a>, and continued on the Counter-Seal, No. 447, and
is as follows:&mdash; S&nbsp;:&nbsp;THOE : COMITIS : WARRWYCHIE : ANNO :
REGNI : REGIS : E : T’CII : POST : CŌQVESTV̄ : ANGLIE : SEPTIO : DECIO :

Warwick, in the seventeenth year of the reign of King Edward III. (of
that name) after the Conquest of England, and the fourth of his reign
over France.” Thus, the date of the execution of this fine Seal is the
year 1344. The Earl himself died in 1369.</p>

is the Seal of <span class = "smallcaps">Richard de Beauchamp</span>,
K.G., fifth Earl of <span class = "smallcaps">Warwick</span>, who died
in the year 1439. The Heraldry in this example is particularly
interesting. The Shield, charged with <i>Newburgh</i> and
<i>Beauchamp</i> quarterly, is couchée from the helm of the Earl which
is ensigned with his coronet and crest; and on either side is <i>a bear
with a ragged staff</i>, the famous Badges of the <span class =

<p>III. In <span class = "smallcaps">Gothic Architecture</span> Heraldry
is always a consistent, beautiful, and most effective accessory. Indeed,
so thoroughly is the spirit of Heraldry in harmony with the great
Architecture which grew up in the Middle Ages, that Heraldry must be
considered rather as an element of its nature than as an allied Art.
Gothic Architecture is essentially heraldic; and hence, as well as from
its elastic nature and its equally consistent and happy applicability to
every use and requirement, it is peculiarly appropriate as our own
national style.</p>

<p>From the earliest years of its existence as a definite Science,
Heraldry is found to be most intimately associated with the Gothic
Architecture of England: and happy it
<span class = "pagenum">322</span>
<a name = "page322" id = "page322"> </a>
was for the early Heralds, that in their days the English Gothic was at
work in the full strength of its first maturity. And this alliance was
never interrupted, or permitted to decline from its original cordiality.
As long as the Gothic flourished, Heraldry held its own place in
Architecture. And in the finest works that exist amongst us, relics of
the grand Gothic Ages of English Architecture, Heraldry is ever present
to adorn them with its graphic records. In the spandrels of arcades, in
panels, upon bosses in vaulting, in stained glass, in encaustic
floor-tiles, and indeed in almost every position in which such
ornamentation could be admissible, the early Herald is found to have
been the fellow-worker with the early Gothic architect. Gothic
Architecture, accordingly, has preserved for us very noble collections
and specimens of the most valuable illustrations of our national
Heraldry. Canterbury and York Cathedrals, and the Abbey Churches of
Westminster and St. Alban’s, with the Chapel of King’s College,
Cambridge, are especially rich in heraldic treasures: and Westminster
Hall and the northern Castles of Alnwick and Warkworth may be specified
as noble examples of secular Architecture, which retain their heraldic
enrichments.</p>

<p>IV. Gothic <span class = "smallcaps">Monuments</span>, and in common
with them their successors of the Renaissance era, abound in every
variety of armorial blazonry. And fine examples of heraldic Monuments
are no less abundant, than are the Shields and other insignia that
appear on particular memorials. The principles which directed the
selection of Shields to be introduced into the composition of early
Monuments are worthy of careful consideration: and the same remark is no
less applicable in the case of Architecture. I&nbsp;must be content to
specify a very small group of heraldic Monuments of especial interest
and value. In Westminster Abbey: the Monuments of Queens <span class =
"smallcaps">Alianore</span> of Castile, <span class =
"smallcaps">Philippa</span> of Hainault, <span class =
"smallcaps">Elizabeth Tudor</span>, and <span class = "smallcaps">Mary
Stuart</span>; the Monuments of King <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> and King
<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<a name = "page323" id = "page323"> </a>
<span class = "smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;VII.</span>; and those of <span
class = "smallcaps">Alianore de Bohun</span>, Duchess of <span class =
"smallcaps">Gloucester</span>, the Countess of <span class =
"smallcaps">Lennox</span>, the Countess of <span class =
"smallcaps">Derby</span>, the two <span class = "smallcaps">De
Valences</span>, Earls of Pembroke, <span class =
"smallcaps">Edmund</span>, Earl of Lancaster, Lord <span class =
"smallcaps">Bourchier</span>, and Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Giles
Daubeney</span>, K.G. In Canterbury Cathedral: the Monuments of the
<span class = "smallcaps">Black Prince</span>, and of <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Joanna</span> of Navarre. In Salisbury Cathedral: the
Monument of Earl <span class = "smallcaps">William Longespée</span>. In
St. Alban’s Abbey Church: the Monuments of <span class =
"smallcaps">Humphrey</span>, Duke of <span class =
"smallcaps">Gloucester</span>, and of the Abbots <span class =
"smallcaps">Wheathamstede</span> and <span class =
"smallcaps">Ramryge</span>. Also, other fine Monuments in the Churches
at Elsyng in Norfolk, Ewelme and Northleigh in Oxfordshire, King’s
Langley in Hertfordshire, and Cobham in Kent; in Beverley Minster, and
in the Beauchamp Chapel at Warwick.</p>

<p>V. In the <span class = "smallcaps">Illuminations</span> of the
Middle Ages Heraldry has a place of honour: and in the revival of that
early Art, which is held in such high estimation at the present day,
Heraldry ought to occupy a position of corresponding prominence. This
implies in the Illuminators of to-day some knowledge of Heraldry, and at
least some degree of familiarity with good early examples.
I&nbsp;venture to suggest, therefore, to students of Illumination the
study both of the Herald’s Art and his Science, as no unimportant part
of their preparation for the practice of the Art of Illumination on the
principle of the sagacious maxim of a great modern painter, quoted by
Mr. <span class = "smallcaps">Ruskin</span> in his “Seven Lamps of
Architecture”&mdash;“Know what you have to do, and <i>then</i>
do&nbsp;it.”</p>

<p>VI. In the ornamentation of early <span class =
"smallcaps">Encaustic</span> or <span class = "smallcaps">Inlaid
Pavement Tiles</span>, Shields of Arms and various heraldic devices
frequently occur: and in many examples the Shields of Arms are arranged
with much skill and in excellent taste, to form decorative compositions
in combination with foliage and traceries. Numerous heraldic Tiles of a
very interesting character remain in the Cathedrals of Worcester,
Gloucester, and Exeter; and in the Churches of Great Malvern, King’s
<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<a name = "page324" id = "page324"> </a>
Langley, the Abbey Church of St. Alban, and many others. The student
will observe that the devices upon these Tiles are frequently
<i>reversed</i>, evidently the result of the neglect to reverse the
designs upon the original dies or stamps.</p>

<p>VII. Heraldic blazonry was highly esteemed in the Middle Ages as a
becoming decoration for <span class = "smallcaps">Personal
Costume</span>. The Knights wore their <i>Coats of Arms</i>, and they
carried and used their <i>Shields of Arms</i>, and their armorial
insignia were displayed upon their weapons and upon the various
accessories of their personal equipment. The Ladies adapted this usage
to their own Costume, and they also wore <i>Mantles and Dresses of
Arms</i>; and many of their personal ornaments were strictly heraldic.
Without even suggesting now to our Ladies any revival of heraldic
costume, properly so called&mdash;such as dresses, mantles, or shawls
emblazoned with the bearings of armorial shields&mdash;I certainly do
desire to see Heraldry exercising a powerful influence in all designs
for personal ornaments, the works of the goldsmith and the jeweller more
especially. Badges also may supply the motive for designing many
patterns that are to adorn fabrics used for costume: and, in like manner
also, the designs woven into carpets, curtains, and various other
fabrics may be derived with the greatest advantage from the same source.
The loom is employed in blazoning heraldic insignia in white damask: why
should it not work, under judicious and cautious guidance, in silk and
velvet, in satin and every woollen fabric?<a class = "tag" name =
"tag13" id = "tag13" href = "#note13">13</a></p>

<p>It must be understood, however, that heraldic ornaments and devices,
unless they be of such a character that they are universally applicable,
must have a reference to the wearer, or they degenerate at once into
heraldic parodies.
<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<a name = "page325" id = "page325"> </a>
Personal ornaments, costume, furniture, if heraldic, must display
devices that have a significance as well as a beauty: such costume and
ornaments must be, not “becoming” only to the wearer, but (in the
heraldic acceptation of that term) “belonging” also. And so in every
instance.</p>

<p>For purposes of universal decoration and adornment, Heraldry is no
less applicable now than when <span class =
"smallcaps">Edward&nbsp;III.</span> or <span class =
"smallcaps">Henry&nbsp;IV.</span> reigned in England. Happily,
a&nbsp;taste for furniture and all the appliances of every-day life in
the Gothic style is gradually becoming prevalent; and this is
inseparable from the use of Heraldry for the purposes of ornamentation.
I&nbsp;presume that the fallacy of regarding the Gothic style of Art as
exclusively ecclesiastical in its associations and uses, or as no less
necessarily inseparable from mediæval sentiments and general usages, is
beginning to give way to more correct views, as the true nature of the
Gothic and its original universal employment are better understood.
I&nbsp;consider it to be unnecessary for me, therefore, to enter here,
in support of my own sentiments, into any detailed explanations to show
that the revival of a Style of Art which flourished in bygone ages, and
with it the revival of Heraldry as it was invented and grew into its
early dignity and popularity, are in no way or degree whatever connected
with an implied return to the mode of life of four, five, or six
centuries ago. We have used Roman and even what we intended to be Greek
Architecture in nineteenth-century England; we are still in the habitual
use of Roman and Greek designs for every variety of decoration; and of
late we have added Egyptian and Scandinavian works of Art to the
deservedly prized collections of models, that we have formed for the
express purpose of imitating them: and yet we do not consider that we
thus in any way bind ourselves to adopt Roman, or Greek, or Egyptian, or
Scandinavian costumes or customs; nor in our use of the Arts of
Antiquity do we perceive any demonstration of retrogression in
ourselves.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<a name = "page326" id = "page326"> </a>
<p>It is the same with Mediæval Heraldry and Gothic Art<ins class =
"correction" title = ". missing">. </ins>We may apply to our own times,
our own uses, our own delight, what the old Heralds and the Gothic
Artists have taught us, without even dreaming of wearing armour or
re-establishing the feudal system. True Heraldry (for it is with
Heraldry that I am now more especially concerned) is a Science, and it
also is an Art, for all time&mdash;for our times, and for future times,
as well as for the times that are past. If we understand and appreciate
it, we shall not fail to use and to apply it aright.</p>

<p>From the initial-letter of my first Chapter I suspended the Shield
borne by that Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Walter Scott</span>, of
Abbotsford, whose name will ever be a household word with every lover of
what is chivalrous and knightly. Here I place the Seal, No. 449, of an
earlier Sir <span class = "smallcaps">Walter Scott</span>, of Branxholm
and Kirkurd&mdash;a Knight of another branch of the same distinguished
House, who differenced the Shield of Scott so as to bear&mdash;<i>Or, on
a bend azure a mullet and two crescents gold</i>.</p>

The specimens of the existing Coinage of Europe, displayed at the
Universal Exposition, at Paris, showed that if the art of the English
Mint is now at a low ebb, the prevailing standard of numismatic art is
not a single degree higher, the coins of France alone being in many
respects an honourable exception to the general rule.</p>

I have lately seen a design for the embroidery of a dress for a young
lady of the Clan <span class = "smallcaps">Campbell</span>; its
characteristic features are the Scottish Thistle and the Myrtle, the
latter the Badge of the Campbells. I&nbsp;may express my approval of the
motive of this design: others, as I have reason to believe, have
approved the treatment of it.</p>

<p class = "first">
<span class = "firstword">Although</span> the name of the dignity of
Earl is derived from a Saxon word, the dignity itself, like all others,
is more Norman than Saxon in its character. At the period of the
Conquest, and whilst the Norman dynasty was on the throne, there were a
number of people who bore this title. At that time and for long
afterwards, certainly well into the Plantagenet period, an Earl within
his earldom was little short of a petty sovereign. Issues of justice and
many other rights of regality were in his hands, and he occupied a
position very much akin to a viceroy for the King, seeing that what he
did he did in his own name and as Earl, or “comes,” of the County. The
High Sheriff was the “vice-comes.” Some of the earldoms had more
extensive rights of regality than others, some were actual palatinates,
and all earldoms originally were honours in fee heritable by the
heir-general. Earldoms had a territorial nature, and the Earl took his
“third penny” in the issues of the Courts in his earldom.</p>

<p>The only other dignity at that period was that of Baron, and just as
the Earls of to-day have little in common save
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
<a name = "page328" id = "page328"> </a>
dignity and title with the Earls of the past, so the Barons originally
were very unlike the latest creations of modern Prime Ministers in the
name of the King. At the Norman Conquest, and for long afterwards, the
Barons, an indeterminate number, were those who held their land in
barony.</p>

<p>It is a matter of much uncertainty at what date Parliament came into
being. The word goes back to a much earlier period, and is used
concerning a variety of meetings which are now generally regarded as
meetings of different Councils and not of Parliament, but historians are
agreed that whether or not any earlier meetings can be properly
described as Parliaments, the Parliament of 1295 was properly and fully
constituted in all its elements. To this Parliament all those who were
personally summoned by the King in their own names and were not
nominated or elected by other people are Peers, and of these Peers those
who are not described as Earls are Barons. It should, however, be noted
that Bishops and Abbots were summoned by right of the offices they held,
and there are certain other officials who were summoned also because of
their offices and could be distinguished from the Barons and Earls.
There is no shadow of doubt that the reason for the summoning of the
Barons was the fact that they were great subjects and important because
of their ownership of land. It was landowners who had to provide the
military services for the country, and Parliament was chiefly concerned,
not in law-making, but in authorising and consulting as to military
expeditions, or in providing the subsidies necessary for these
expeditions, and the other services of the Crown. In addition to this
Peers exercised some of the judicial functions of the Crown. But
law-making was done by the King and his Council until a later period.
The landed qualifications which justified the summoning of a man to
Parliament as a Baron usually descended to his heir and similarly
justified the summoning of that heir; and in
<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<a name = "page329" id = "page329"> </a>
that way, but without any intention to that end, the right of summons
and the right of peerage became hereditary. Originally it had been
arbitrary and at the discretion of the Crown. It was not until the reign
of Edward IV. that the hereditary peerage character of a barony was
fully recognised, and with that recognition came the divorce of the
territorial idea from the right of peerage. Like ancient earldoms,
ancient baronies were honours in fee heritable by the heirs general.
Save that William the Conqueror was Sovereign Lord of the Duchy of
Normandy and as such Duke, the dignity of duke did not exist in England
until 1337, when Edward the Black Prince was created Duke of Cornwall
with remainder to his heirs the eldest sons of the Kings of England.
That was the creation of the title now enjoyed by the Prince of Wales,
but this Duchy of Cornwall and the Duchy of Lancaster are really Duchies
as distinguished from the Dukedoms enjoyed by other people having the
designation of Duke.</p>

<p>The title of Marquis dates from 1386, when Richard II. created Robert
de Vere Marquis of Dublin; and the title of Viscount from 1440, when the
Viscounty of Beaumont was created. The first Barony by Letters Patent
was created in 1387, but the oldest surviving barony by patent now in
existence dates from 1448, when Sir John Stourton was created Baron and
Lord Stourton of Stourton, co. Wilts. The present Lord Mowbray, Segrave
and Stourton, who has inherited the barony of Stourton, also claims, as
Lord Mowbray, to be the premier baron of England although the barony of
Mowbray is placed on the roll of precedence after the baronies of Le
Despenser and De Ros. Although earldoms were granted by charters from
the earliest period, because, attached to the earldom, were also
material rights which needed to be conveyed, patents did not come into
use for baronies until it was desired to limit the succession of the
peerage to the heirs male of the body of the grantee,
<span class = "pagenum">330</span>
<a name = "page330" id = "page330"> </a>
which is a limitation and a less heirship than is comprised in the
enjoyment of an honour in fee simple. Privilege of peerage with all it
entails has been a slow growth of accretion; and save for place and
precedence and the right of any peer or peeress to be tried in the House
of Lords, and the now limited and threatened right of peers to
legislate, little of privilege of peerage remains.</p>

<p>The peerage of Scotland is very similar to that of England, and,
before the Union, the principal difference between the two countries was
the persistency with which the Scottish peerage remained attached to the
land. Until a late date a patent creating a Scottish peerage erected
certain lands into a barony or earldom as the case might be, and
entailed those lands with the dignity. The difference arising from this
form of procedure was more than counterbalanced by the recognised and
constantly-adopted procedure of resigning a Scottish inheritance into
the hands of the Crown, and then obtaining what is known as a
“Novodamus,” with either the same or different limitations.</p>

<p>The many Scottish remainders, which are quite unknown to English
peerage law, are all a consequence of this territorial nature of a
Scottish peerage. One of the chief differences at the present time
between an English and a Scottish peerage is to be found in those which
are heritable by females. Unless governed by special remainder contained
in the instrument of creation, a&nbsp;Scottish peerage, which in the
event of failure of a male heir devolves upon a female heir, differs
from an English one in its manner of descent. In Scotland the elder
daughter inherits as of right, standing in the line of heirship next
after her youngest brother and before any uncle or a younger sister. On
the other hand, such an inheritance is only known by virtue of a special
remainder in England. All Baronies by writ are Baronies in fee in
England, and
<span class = "pagenum">331</span>
<a name = "page331" id = "page331"> </a>
heritable by the heir general, which means that they can if necessary
devolve upon females. If the only child of a peer having such a peerage
be a daughter she inherits in her own right, but if his issue is two
daughters, then the peerage falls into abeyance between them, because
under the law of England there is no seniority amongst daughters, and as
both of them cannot enjoy one single peerage, neither of them has it,
and it remains in abeyance until the Crown interferes or until by the
natural course of events one line becomes extinguished by the extinction
of all issue of the one daughter, when the peerage then at once devolves
upon the heir of the other. Sometimes an abeyance will last several
hundred years, sometimes it may end with the lapse of one or two; but at
any time during the continuance of an abeyance the Crown may, at its
entire pleasure, signify that any co-heir shall enjoy the peerage. This
is what is termed the determination of an abeyance, and this is effected
by the issue of a writ of summons to Parliament if the co-heir be a male
or by the issue of letters patent in the case of a lady. The co-heir in
whose favour the abeyance is determined then at once enjoys the peerage
with the same designation and precedence as those who have held it
hitherto, and his or her heir succeeds in due course.</p>

<p>Although there is one judgment to the contrary, it is now pretty
universally admitted that there is no such thing as an Irish Barony by
writ. With the union of England and Scotland, no further peerages of
either country were created, and subsequent peerages were either of
Great Britain or of Ireland; and it has been already judicially decided
by the House of Lords that the power to create a Scottish peerage does
not now exist in the Crown. There is no similar judgment in relation to
a peerage of England, but the fact is that no attempt has since been
made to create one, and though the point up to the
<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<a name = "page332" id = "page332"> </a>
present time still has to be decided, it is certainly a matter for
argument whether or not such a right remains. Since the union of Great
Britain with Ireland no further peerages of Great Britain or of England
have been created, but the right to create peers of Ireland was
specifically retained under certain conditions and has been constantly
taken advantage of. Other peerages since created have, however, been of
the United Kingdom. Whether or not we shall ever have peerages of the
Empire remains a matter for the future.</p>

<p>Since the latter part of the seventeenth century it has been the
custom for peers and peeresses in their own right to sign simply by the
designation of their peerage. The peeress by marriage prefixes her
Christian name or initials to her husband’s title. It is statute law in
Scotland, but not in England, that no person may sign his surname
without prefixing a Christian name or initials. A&nbsp;peeress by
marriage who is also a peeress in her own right signs first her
husband’s title, adding her own afterwards; for instance, the signature
of the Countess of Yarborough is Marcia Yarborough, Fauconberg and
Conyers. One cannot call to mind in recent times any instances in which
the peeress in her own right has married a peer of lower rank than her
own, and until such a case occurs it is difficult to forecast what the
signature should be. A&nbsp;peeress by marriage after re-marriage loses
all privilege of peerage and precedence, and all right which she
acquired by marriage, but as a matter of courtesy she usually retains
her peerage designation if her subsequent marriage is to a commoner.</p>

<p>The daughter of a peer if married to another peer takes the
precedence of her husband and relinquishes her own, but she retains it
if she marries a commoner; and one of the anomalies of the English scale
of precedence is to be found in the following circumstances. If the two
elder
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
<a name = "page333" id = "page333"> </a>
daughters of a Duke were to marry an Earl and a Baron respectively,
whilst the youngest daughter were to run away with the footman, she
would, nevertheless, rank as the daughter of a Duke above her sisters
ranking as wives of an Earl and a Baron.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
